It must be construed like any other constitutional provision having regard to its object and intentment. The fact that we are living today in an emergency should not colour our interpretation of the constitutional provision. The constitutional provision must speak the same voice, whether it be in times of emergency or in normal times. We must not forget what Mr. Justice Brande is said in Whitney case (1) \"Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political change. They did not exalt older at the cost of liberty. We may also recall the words of Mr. Justice Murphy in Bridges case(2) where he said \"The strength of this nation is weakened more by those who suppress the freedom of others than those who are allowed freely to think and act as their consciences dictate.\" Moreover, I may point out that the interpretation which I am accepting does not in any way whittle down or affect the power of the State to detain with a view to meeting a situation arising out of the emergency.

In these writ petitions filed under article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners question the legality of their detente and pray for issue of writs in the nature of habeas corpus. These petitions raise a common constitutional question, namely, whether Parliament is bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22(7)(b) of the Constitution in order that the proviso to article 22(4)(e) might operate, and, whether, by s. 13 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 (Act 26 of 1971), hereinafter referred to as the Act, after it was amended by s. 6(d) of the Defence of India Act, 1971, the Parliament has prescribed the \"maximum period\". The orders passed by the Government of West Bengal under s.12 (1) of the Act in these cases provide that the Governor is-pleased to confirm the orders of detention and to continue the detention of the detenues till the expiration of 12 months from the dates of their detention of until the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, whichever is later.\r\n\r\nThe material part of s. 13 of the Act as it originally stood ran as follows :\r\n\r\n\"The maximum period for which any person may be detained in pursuance of any detention order which has been confirmed under s. 12 shall be twelve months from the date of detention.\"\r\nAfter it was amended by s. 6(d) of the Defence of India Act, 1971, the material part of s. 13 of the Act reads \"The maximum period for which any person may be detained it% pursuance of any detention order which has been confirmed under s. 12 shall be twelve months from the date of detention or until the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, whichever is later.\"\r\nThe Defence of India Act, 1971, came into force on December 4, 1971. Section 1(3) of that Act provides that the Act shall come into force at once and shall remain in force during the period of operation of the Proclamation of Emergency and for a period of six months thereafter. Section 2(g) of that Act defines \"Proclamation of Emergency\" as the proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 352 of the Constitution on the 3rd day of December, 1971. The President issued the Proclamation of Emergency under article 352 of the Constitution on December 3, 1971. Article 22(4)(a) of the Constitution says that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a period longer then three months unless an Advisory Board has reported before the expiry of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention. The proviso to the article provides that nothing in sub-clause (a) shall authorize, the detention of any person \"beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause (7)\" of article 22. By reason of article 22 (4) (b), a person can be detained for a longer period than three months without the necessity of consulting an Advisory Board if \"such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses\r\n\r\n(a) and (b) of clause (7)\" of article 22. And, article 22(7) says \"(7) Parliament may by law prescribe-\r\n\r\n(a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of subclause (a) of clause (4);\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention; and\r\n\r\n(c)the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4).\"\r\n\r\nThe contentions of the petitioners were that the Parliament was bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b) of the Constitution in order that the, proviso to article 22(4) (a) might operate and, as S. 13 of the Act as amended did not prescribe \"the maximum period\" of detention, the confirmation of the detention orders in terms of s. 13 of the Act was bad.\r\n\r\nThe learned Attorney General, who appeared for the respondent in these petitions, submitted that in s. 13 of the Act the parliament has prescribed \"the maximum period\" of detention. And in the alter-\r\n\r\nnative, he said that the Parliament was not. bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention for the proviso to article 22(4)(a) to operate.\r\n\r\nin A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras(1) Kania, C. J. said that article 22(7) (b) is permissive, it being not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe the maximum period and that if this construction resulted in a Parliamentary law enabling the detention of a person for an indefinite period without trial, that unfortunate consequence is the result of the words of article 22(7) itself and that the Court could do nothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn Krishnan v. The State of Madras(2), s. 11 of the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, was impugned as violative of article 22 (4) (a) on the ground that S. 11 did not fix a maximum period of detention, but on the contrary, empowered the Government in express terms to order that the detenu was to continue in detention for such period as it thought fit. The Court, by a majority, held that s.11 was not invalid on the ground that it did not fix the maximum period of detention inasmuch as the Act was to be in force only for a period of one year and no detention under that Act could be continued after the expiry of the Act. Mahajan, J. pointed out that the point was concluded by the decision in Gopalan\'s case(1) where Kania, C.J. had observed that it was not obligatory on Parliament to\' prescribe any maximum period. On the other hand, Bose, J. who wrote a dissenting judgment, held that though it was not obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention under article 22(7)(b), if it wanted to detain a person for a period longer than three months, it could only do so by providing in the Act the maximum period of detention. In the State of West Bengal v. Ashok Dey and Others(3) the central issue was whether a State Legislature has power to pass a law providing for preventive detention of a person for a period longer than three months even after obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board that there was sufficient cause for detention, unless the Parliament has prescribed the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). The contention was that there was no such power. The Court negatived the contention and said that article 22(7) is couched in, a permissive way, that there is nothing mandatory about it and that the majority decision in Krishnan\'s case(2) following the observation of Kania, C.J. in Gopalan\'s case(3) was binding on the, Court. The Court also said that under entry 3 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, both Parliament and State legislatures have concurrent power to make laws in respect of \"preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; persons subject to such detention\", and that as the State legislatures have plenary power to make- law providing for preventive, detention within the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the power must necessarily extend to all (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88, (2) [1951] S.C.R. 621 (3) [1972] 1 S.C.C. 199.\r\n\r\nmatters incidental to preventive detention as contemplated by this entry subject only to the condition that the law made by the State should not come into conflict with a law made by Parliament with respect to the same matter. The Court came to the conclusion that there was no limitation on the power of a State legislature to make a law providing for detention for a period beyond three months for the reason that Parliament has not made a law prescribing the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). Great reliance was placed by the petitioners on the reasoning contained in the dissenting judgment of Bose, J. in Krishnan\'s case (supra) for the proposition that the fixation by law of the maximum period of detention is obligatory upon Parliament in order that the proviso to article 22 (4) (a) may operate.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bose, J., a law providing for detention of a person beyond a period of three months must satisfy either clause (4) (a) or clause (4) (b) of article 22. The learned judge was not, however, prepared to read the word \'may\' in clause (7) of article 22 as meaning must\' as that would change the usual meaning of the word. He was of the view that Parliament is free to prescribe or not to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b) and that neither Parliament nor State legislature can be compelled to pass a law authorising preventive detention beyond three months but, if, however, either wishes to do so, then it is bound to conform to the provisions of either sub-clause (a) or (b) of article 22(4) or both, and that, in the case, of sub-clause (a), the proviso is as much a part of the sub-clause as its main provision. The learned judge then said that if no maximum limit is prescribed under sub- clause (b) of article 22(7), the proviso to article 22 (4)\r\n\r\n(a) cannot operate, and, if it cannot operate, no legisla- tive action can be taken under clause (4) (a), and resorted to reasoning from analogies to fortify his conclusion. He observed : \"\'If A is told by B that he may go to a bank and withdraw a sum of money not exceeding such limit as may be fixed by C, it is evident that until C fixes the limit no money can be withdrawn. Equally, if A is told that he may withdraw money not exceeding a limit which he himself may fix, there can, in my opinion, be no right of withdrawal until he fixes the limit\". He concluded his judgment by saying that the majority judgment amounted to the Constitution telling all persons resident in the land that \"though we authorise Parliament to prescribe a maximum limit of detention if it so chooses, we place no compulsion on it to do so and we authorise it to pass legislation which will empower any person or authority Parliament chooses to name, right down to, a police constable, to arrest you and detain you as long as he pleases, for the duration of your life if he wants, so that you may linger and rot in jail. till you die, as did men in the Bastille\".\r\n\r\nWe think the analogies which the learned judge referred to are, In fact, misleading and his seasonings from them not convincing.\r\n\r\nUnder entry 3 of List III of the Seventh Schedule, both Parliament and State legislatures have plenary power to pass laws for preventive detention as respects the subjects mentioned therein. As ancillary to that power, or, as an inseparable part of it. Parliament and State legislatures have power to fix the period of detention also. One cannot imagine a power to pass a law for detention unless that power carries with it the incidental power to provide for the period of such detention. Therefore, both Parliament and State legislatures have power under the entry to provide for detention of a person for a specified period. the purpose of article 22 (4) (a) is to put a curb on that power by provid- ing that no law shall authorize the detention,of a person for a period exceeding three months unless an Advisory board has reported within the period of three months that there is sufficient cause for detention. And, what the proviso means is that even if the Advisory Board has reported before the expiration of three months that there is sufficient cause for detention, the period of detention beyond three months shall not exceed the maximum period that might be fixed by any law made by Parliament under article 22(7) (b). The proviso cannot mean that even if Parliament does not pass a law fixing the maximum period under article 22 (7) (b), the State legislatures, for example, cannot pass a law which provides for detention of a person beyond three months. The period of such detention,, viz., detention beyond the period of three months, would then be a matter within the plenary power of Parliament or State legislatures, as the case may be, as such a power is incidental to the power to pass a law with respect to the topics covered by entry 3 of List III. It is therefore clear that, but for the proviso to clause (4) (a) of article 22, the Act, as it provides for the opinion of the Advisory Board, can authorize detention of a person for any period, by virtue of the plenary character of the legislative power conferred by the entry. Whether such a law is liable to be struck down on the ground that it imposes unreasonable restrictions upon the fundamental rights under article 19 is an altogether different question. The proviso says in effect that if Parliament fixes the maximum period under article 22(7) (b), the power of Parliament and State legislatures to fix the period of detention in a law passed under the entry would be curtailed to that extent.\r\n\r\nSeeing, therefore, that the power to pass a law providing for detention of a person after obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board includes the power to fix any reasonable period beyond three months by virtue of the plenary character of the legislative power conferred by the entry, the proper analogy would be : A has authority from B to draw any amount from a bank but he is told that if C fixes a limit upon that authority then be can only draw the amount as fixed by C, in such a case. if C does not fix the amount the power of A to draw is plenary. Or, if A is told that he may withdraw money not exceeding a limit which he himself may fix. A has power to draw any amount, nay, the whole amount in the Bank, if only he fixes the limit at that amount. The condition-precedent, namely. the fixation of the amount by A in such a case, would be wholly illusory, for whatever be chooses to draw would be the limit of his authority. To put it differently, as Parliament and State legislatures have power under the entry to pass a law enabling the detention of a person for a period longer than three months in case the law provides for the opinion of the Advisory Board, there could be no limit to that period, except in the context of its reasonableness, as the power to fix the period of detention is incidental to the plenary power to legislate on the topic of preventive detention. The proviso merely enables Parliament to put a curb on that power by prescribing the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). The proviso does not, proprio vigore, compel the Parliament to fix the maximum period. Nor does article 22(7). On the other hand, it expressly says otherwise. Whence then arises the obligation of Parliament to fix the maximum period under article 22 (7) (b) ? We see no provision which either expressly or by necessary implication compels Parliament to do so. Personal liberty is a cherished freedom, more cherished perhaps than all other freedoms, and we are deeply concerned that no man may linger and rot in detention. As judges and citizens., personal liberty is as dear to us as to anyone else and we may respectfully venture to make the same assumption in regard to those judges who were parties to the decisions in Gopalan\'s case(1), Krishnan\'s case(2) and Ashok Dey\'s case(3). But the problem here is one of dispassionate interpretation of the article in question and we cannot import an obligation that Parliament \"shall\" by law prescribe the maximum period of detention. Such an obligation could only arise from an invisible, radiation proceeding from a vague and speculative concept of personal liberty. The language\' of article 22(4(b) is in marked contrast with that of article 22 (4) (a) read with the proviso. Article 22(4) (b) makes it obligatory upon Parliament, if it wants to pass a law for detaining a person for a period of more than three months without making a provision in that law for obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board within three months. to comply with sub- clauses (a) and (b) of article 22(7). We, therefore, see no sufficient reason for departing from the view taken in the decisions of this Court referred to earlier as regards the power of Parliament under article 22(7) (b). The question whether, when Parliament passes a law under article 22(7) (b) fixing the maximum period of detention in any class of cases, it is exercising an independent power of fixing the maximum period of detention derived from clause (7) of article 22 or a power traceable to the entries on the subject of preventive detention, does not arise for consideration here. If the exercise of the power under article 22(7) is independent of the power conferred by the entries relating to preventive detention, the question whether a law passed by virtue of any of the entries fixing a period of detention in excess of the maximum period fixed by a law passed under article 22 (7) (b) would, sub-silentio repeal the provision in regard to the maximum period in the law passed under article 22(7), and make that period \"the maximum period\" for the purpose of article, 22(7) (b) does not also strictly arise for consideration. But this much we think is certain, namely, that the prescription of a \'maximum period\' by a law made under article 22(7) (b) has no particular sanctity so far as Parliament is concerned, as it could pass a law for detention the (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. (2) [1951] S.C.R. 621. (3) [1972] 1 S.C.C. 199.\r\n\r\nnext day providing for a higher \'maximum period\' and justify that law as a law passed both under the relevant entry relating \'to preventive detention and under article 22 (7)\r\n\r\n(b). To put it differently, the, view that the prescription of the maximum period under article 22(7)(b) is a guarantee that the Parliament cannot pass a law providing for longer period of detention than the maximum period fixed under article 22(7)(b) has no solid foundation, as the law of detention fixing the longer period would sub silentio repeal the law under article 22(7)(b) fixing the \'maximum period\'. As Parliament has power to repeal a law fixing the maximum period under article 22(7)(b), the longer period fixed under the later law of detention would become the maximum period.\r\n\r\nDetention without trial is a serious matter. It is only natural that it should conjure up lurid pictures of men pining in Bastille. But malignant diseases call for drastic remedies. And it was this realization that made the Constitution-makers-all lovers of liberty-to reconcile themselves to the idea of detention without trial. Even if it is granted that Parliament is bound to fix the maximum period of detention, as we said, such a fixation cannot be immutable. what then is the great guarantee of personal liberty in the fixation of the maximum period of detention by Parliament, if that fixation can fluctuate with the mood of Parliament ?\r\n\r\nThe learned Attorney General contended in the alternative that if S. 13 as amended is regarded as fixing the maximum period of detention under article 22(7) (b), it does not suffer from any infirmity on the score that the period fixed is indefinite as contended by the petitioners. The petitioners bad contended that the expression \"the maximum period\" occurring in article 22(7) (b) connotes a definite period reckoned in terms of years, months or days and that no period can be said to be a maximum period unless it is possible to predicate its beginning and end in terms of years, months or days. In other words, the argument was that since the determination of the period of detention, namely, the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, is de- pendent upon the revocation of the Proclamation of Emergency, the period fixed in S. 13 is not \"the maximum period\" as visualized by article 22 (7) (b). The meaning of the word \'maximum\' is, \"the highest attainable magnitude or quantity (of some thing), a superior limit\" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary, p. 1221, (1953), 3rd ed.). The meaning of the word \'period\' is \" A course or extent of time; Time of duration\" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary, p. 1474). Therefore, the words \"maximum period\" mean the highest or greatest course or extent or stretch of time. The highest or greatest course or extent or stretch of time may be measured in terms of years, months or days, as well as in terms of the occurrence of an event or the continuous of a state of affairs.\r\n\r\nIn Juggilal Kamlapat v. Collector, Bombay(1), the High Court of Bombay was concerned with the question whether a requisition (1) A.I.R. 1946 Bombay 280.\r\n\r\nder which stated that the requisition of the immovable property in question was to continue during the period of \"the, present war and x months thereafter\" was vague and indefinite. Bhagwati, J. said \"The period of the present war through indefinite in duration was definite in itself in so far as the petitioners were given in as clear terms as it could be an indication of the period for which their property was sought to be requisitioned by respondent 1 viz., the duration of the present war. The user of this term was as definite as the user of the ex-\r\n\r\npression \"the life time of A\" which is used when settling or bequeathing a remainder in favour of B. B could not be heard to say that the life time of A which was the period prescribed as the one which was to come to an end before the remainder would vest in possession in his favour was a term which was vague or indefinite. It was as clear and definite as it could be, having regard to the fact that the period of the life time of an individual is indeterminate, though that life is of necessity going to come to an end some time or other\".\r\n\r\nWe do not think it necessary that Parliament should have fixed a period in terms of years, months or days in order that it might be \"the maximum period\" for the purpose of article 2Z(7) (b). Seeing that the object of the law of preventive detention is to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of internal security, or of public order, or of supplies and services essential to the community or other objects specified in entry 9 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, we see great force in the contention of the learned Attorney General that \"the maximum period\" in article 22(7) (b) can be fixed with reference to the duration of an emergency. In other words, as the object of preventive detention is to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of internal security, public order or supplies or services essential to the community or other objects specified in entry 9 of List I, the power to detain must be adequate in point of duration to achieve the object. And, how can the power be adequate in point of duration, if it is insufficient to cope with an emergency created by war or public disorder or shortage of supplies essential to the community, the duration of which might be incapable of being predicted in terms of years, months or days even by those gifted with great prophetic vision ? If \'the maximum period\" can be fixed only in terms of years, months or days, certainly it would have been open to Parliament to fix a long period in S. 13 and justify it as \"the maximum period\". It would be straining the gnat and swallowing the camel if anybody is shocked by the fixation of the maximum period of detention with reference to the duration of an emergency but could stomach with complacency the fixation of maximum period, say, at fifteen or twenty years. Whether the fixation of a \"maximum period\" in terms of years or in terms of events is reasonable in a particular circumstance, is a totally different matter. it was argued on behalf of one of the interveners on the basis of the decision of this Court in B. Shama Rao v. The Union Territory of Pondicherry(1) that the Parliament has abdicated its power al. duty to fix maximum period to the executive as the determination the duration of the Proclamation of the Emergency is a matter with the discretion of the President and he is, therefore, the authority to determine the retirement age of the Defence of India Act. We do not think that the Parliament, in fixing the duration of the maximum period of detention with reference to an event like the cessation of the period of emergency, has, in any way, abdicated its power or function to fix the maximum period or delegated it to the President. There can be no doubt that it is Parliament that has fixed the maximum period in S. 13 of the Act. The only question is whether, because the duration of the period is dependent upon the volition of the President, it ceases to be \"the maximum period\". We cannot presume that the President will act unreasonably and continue the Proclamation of Emergency even after the emergency has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners argued that s. 13 of the Act is bad for the reason that it is violative of their fundamental right under article 19 of the Constitution. This challenge is not open to them as it is precluded by the Proclamation of Emergency. Although it was argued that s. 13 of the Act is violative of article 14 of the Constitution for the reason that it has conferred unlimited discretion on the detaining authority to fix the period of detention, we do not think that there is any substance in that contention. The authority which passes the initial order of detention is not expected to fix the period of detention [see Krishnan\'s case(supra)], nay, it may be illegal if it were to do so. Nor is the Government bound, when confirming the order of detention, under s. 12(1) of the Act, to fix the period of detention [see Suna Ullah v. State of J N K(2). Even if a period is fixed in confirming the detention order under S. 12(1), the period can be revoked or modified (see s. 13). The maximum period of detention has been fixed by s. 13 and the discretion to fix the duration within the maximum has been given to the Government after considering all the relevant circumstances. Seeing that the maximum period of detention has been fixed by S. 13 and that the discretion to fix the period of detention in a particular case has to be exercised after taking into account a number of imponderable circumstances, we do not think that there is any substance in the argument that the power of Government to determine the period of detention is discriminatory or arbitrary. In the result, we overrule the contention of the petitioners and direct the writ petitions to be listed for disposal. ALAGIRISWAMI, J. I have read the judgment of our learned brother Mathew, J. and with respect I differ from him on the question whether it is obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention. I shall analyse the relevant provisions later but I shall first deal with three decisions which have dealt with this question.\r\n\r\n(1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 650.\r\n\r\n(2) A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 2431.\r\n\r\nIn A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras(1) the six learned Judges comprising the Bench delivered separate judgments. Kania C. J. was the only Judge who dealt with this point in these words :\r\n\r\n\"It was argued that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely. If that construction is correct, it springs out of the words of sub- clause (7) itself and the Court cannot help in the matter.\"\r\nIt would be noticed that there is no discussion at all here as to whether the learned Chief Justice came to the conclusion that the contention was correct or not or how it springs out of the words of subclause (7) that it was not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe any maximum period.\r\nIn the next case of S. Krishnan v. The State of Madras(2) Patanjali Sastri, J. with whom Kania, C.J. agreed, did not deal with this question at all. Mahajan, J., with whom S. R. Das, J. agreed substantially on the grounds stated by Mahajan, J. did, of course, deal with this question in these words : \"The next point canvassed before us was that the Constitution does not envisage detention for an indefinite period and that it is obligatory on Parliament to provide a maximum period for detention of a person under a law of preventive detention. In my opinion, this argument again is not sound. Emphasis was laid on the proviso to article 22(4) (a) which enacts that nothing in the sub-clause shall authorize the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause(b)of clause (7)and it was urged that the, word \"may\" in article 22(7) must be read in the sense of \"must\" and as having a compulsory force inasmuch as the enactment authorizes Parlia- ment to prescribe by law a maximum period for detention, for the advancement of justice and for public good, or for the benefit of persons subjected to preventive detention. Reference was made to Maxwell on \"Interpretation of the Statutes\" (9th End., page 246) and to the well-known case of Julius v. Bishop of Oxford(3) Lord Cairns in that case observed as follows :-\r\n\"Where a power is deposited with a public officer for the purpose of being used for the benefit of persons that power ought to be exercised.\"\r\nIn my opinion, clause (7) of article 22, as already pointed out, in its true concept to a certain degree restricts the measure of the fundamental right contained in clause (4) (a) and in this context the rule referred to by Maxwell has no application whatever. Moreover, the provision in the Constitution is merely an enabling one and it is well settled (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. (2) [1951] S.C.R.\r\n621. (3) 5 App. cas. 214.\r\nthat in an enabling Act words of a permissive nature cannot be given a compulsory meaning. (Vide Caries on Statute Law, p. 254). Be that as it may, the point is no longer open as it has been concluded by the majority decision in Gopalan\'s case. The learned Chief Justice at p. 119 of the report observed as follows :- \"Sub-clause (b) is permissive. It is not obligatory on the Parliament to prescribe any maximum period. It was argued that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely. If that construction is correct, it springs out of the words of subclause (7) itself and the court cannot help in the matter.\"\r\nNothing said by Mr. Nambiar is sufficient to persuade me to take a different view of the matter than was taken in Gopalan\'s case. It may be pointed out that Parliament may well have thought that it was unnecessary to fix any maximum period of detention in the statute which was of a temporary nature and whose own tenure of life was limited to one, year. Such temporary statutes cease to have any effect after they expire, they automatically come to an end at the expiry of the period for which they have been enacted and nothing further can be done under them. The detention of the petitioners therefore is bound to come to an end automatically with the life of the statute and in these circumstances Parliament may well have thought that it would be wholly unnecessary to legislate and provide a maximum period of detention for those detained tinder this law.\"\r\nIt would be noticed that while he did discuss this question he thought that the point was concluded by the decision in Gopalan\'s case. As I have pointed out earlier that was not a majority decision but only a passing observation by Kania, C.J. Both these cases mainly proceed on the basis that the Act itself being a temporary Act to be in force for a year the question of maximum period did not arise for serious consideration. Bose, J. however was of the view that it was obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention.\r\nIn the latest case of State of West Bengal v. Ashok Dey(1), which was a judgment by four learned Judges, Dua, J. speaking for the Court said :\r\n\"Now, the argument raised in the High Court and accepted by it and repeated before us by Shri S. N. Chatterji on behalf of the respondents is that clause (7) (b) of Article 22 makes it obligatory for the Parliament to prescribe by law the maximum period for which a person may be detained as also the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board in holding the enquiry under clause (4) (a) of this Article. According to the submission, in the absence of such a law by Parliament no order of detention can authorise detention of any person for a period longer than three months and at the (1) [1972] (1) S.C.C. 199.\r\nexpiry of three months all persons detained under the Act must be released.\r\nWe are unable to accept this construction of clause (7) of Article 22. It is noteworthy that Shri Chatterji, learned counsel for the respondents, expressly conceded before us that Article 22(7) is only an enabling or a permissive provision and it does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Parliament to make a law prescribing the circumstances under which a person may be detained for more than three months as stated therein. But according to him sub-clause (b) and (c) of clause (7) do contain a mandate to the Parliament which is obligatory. In our view, clause (7) of this Article on its plain reading merely authorises or enables the Parliament to make a law prescribing (i) the circumstances under which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months, (ii) the maximum period for which a person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention, and (iii) the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board in an enquiry under clause (4) (a) of this Article. The respondents\' contention that \"may\" in the opening part of this Article must be read as \"shall\" in respect of sub-clauses (b) and (c) though it retains its normal permissive character in so far as clause (a) is concerned, in the absence of special compelling reasons can be supported neither on principle nor by precedent of which we are aware. On the other hand this Court has in S. Krishnan v. State of Madras agreeing with the observations of Kania, C.J. in Gopalan v. State of Madras held sub-clause (b) of clause (7) to be permissive. This opinion is not only binding on us but we are also in respectful agreement with it.\"\r\nThis decision does directly deal with the point but not by detailed analysis of the relevant provisions as done by Mathew, J. and Bhagwati, J. and as I have tried to do later on. The decision, however, war. mainly concerned with the power of the State Legislature to make a law with regard to preventive detention and the whole approach is coloured by this consideration rather than the question whether the prescription of the maximum is obligatory. The power of Parliament to legislate with regard to preventive detention arises under Entry 9, List 1 of the Seventh Schedule as well as Entry 3, List 3 of the Seventh Schedule. The State Legislature has the power to legislate with regard to preventive detention under Entry 3 in List 3 of the Seventh Schedule. This, of course, is subject to the provisions of Article 254(2) of the Constitution. Article 22 is found in Part III of the Constitution regarding fundamental rights. According to Article 1 3 (2) the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the, rights conferred by that Part. Therefore, Article 22 is an article restricting the powers of Parliament and State Legislatures in regard to preventive detention in the manner laid down therein. Of the learned Judges who dealt with Gopalan\'s case. Kania, C.J., Patanjali Sastri and Dass JJ. took the view that Article 22 does not 4-L748SuP. CI/74 form a complete code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention. While Mahajan, J, thought that it contains a self contained code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention, Das, J. thought that Article 22 lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even the Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. Mukherjea, J. proceeded to state his conclusions on the assumption that Art. 22 is not a self-contained code relating to preventive detention. Fazl Ali, J. took the view that Art. 22 does not form an exhaustive code by its,-If relating to preventive detention. All this goes to show that all the learned Judges more or less took the view that Art. 22 obtained certain constitutional safeguards regarding the preventive detention.\r\n\r\nNow let us took at Article 22 in so far as it is necessary for purpose of this discussion : \"Art. 22(4) No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless--\r\n\r\n(a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause (7); or\r\n\r\n(b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under subclauses (a) and (b) of clause (7).\r\n\r\n(7) Parliament may by law prescribe-\r\n\r\na) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4);\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention; and\r\n\r\n(c) I shall now place the various parts of the above provisions separately so as to make matters clear :\r\n\r\n1. No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless the Advisory Board, consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be the appointed as Judges of the High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention. This does not authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause\r\n\r\n3. No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a period longer than three months unless such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parlia- ment prescribing\r\n\r\n(a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a _period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4); (and)\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention.\r\n\r\nThe 1st proposition means that a law providing for preventive detention can authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months only if an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention.\r\n\r\nProposition (2) means that even with the advice of an Advisory Board the detention cannot exceed the maximum period prescribed by law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause (7). I shall deal with the question whether it is obligatory on Parliament to make such a law a little later.\r\n\r\nProposition (3) means that if a person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7) the detention can be for a period longer than three months. It should be noticed that the law contemplated under this proposition is one made under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). Therefore a Parliamentary statute can provide for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board by laying down the circumstances under which and class or classes of cases on which it can be done. In that case the maximum period for which a person can be detained should also be specified by the parliamentary law i.e. a person cannot be detained for a period exceeding three months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board unless tile concerned provision of law also provides for the maximum period for which such a person is to be detained. The Constitution makers have Contemplated that if the Advisory Board\'s opinion is to be dispensed with, the maximum period of detention should be laid down. it is obvious, therefore, that the word \"may\" in Art. 22(7) amounts to `shall\". It is also obvious that the power to dispense with the opinion of an Advisory Board is given only to Parliament. When it makes a law under clause (7) (a) & (b) of Art. 22 that also would bind the State Legislatures in so far as they enact any legislation with regard to preventive detention. This is not, of course, to say that State Legislatures have no power with regard to preventive detention. But they do not have the power to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than 3 months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board. That power is completely that of Parliament and any State legislation will also be subject to the maximum period prescribed by Parliament under a legislation made under Art. 22(7) (a) and (b). The only question that now remains to be considered is whether if an Advisory Board is provided for in a law providing for preventive detention under Article 22(4) a maximum period of detention should be prescribed or not. In considering this question one thing would be obvious : that if Parliament does prescribe a maximum period under proposition (2) i.e. the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a), that would apply to all laws relating to preventive detention whether made by Parliament or by a State Legislature. Apparently the power to prescribe, a maximum period given to Parliament (referred to in this proviso) is to prevent the State Legislatures making laws with regard to preventive detention without any maximum limit. This is another limitation on the powers of the State Legislature to legislate with regard to preventive detention. The Constitution makers apparently did not want the State Legislatures to have an unfettered power with regard to preventive detention even in the field allotted to them under Entry 3 of List 3 of Seventh Schedule. This provision can be usefully compared with the provision of Art. 31(3) which provides for a legislation made under the provisions of clause, (2) of Art. 31 being reserved for consideration of the President and receiving his assent in order that it may have effect. This was intended to act as a fetter on the power of the State Legislatures to legislate under the provisions of Art. 31(2). The only difference between Art. 31(3) and the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a) is that in the one case the power is given to the President and in the other case the power is given to the Parliament. Now if under subclauses (a) and (b) of clause (7), read together, Parliament has to prescribe the maximum period of detention, does the fact that the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a) mentions only sub-clause (b) of clause (7) but not also sub-clause\r\n\r\n(a), makes any difference ? If, as I have already pointed out, this proviso at least contemplates Parliament making a law providing for the maximum period of detention which cannot be exceeded by any State law regarding preventive detention the reasonable construction would be to hold that it is obligatory on Parliament to legislate under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) fettering the hands of the State Legislature in regard to the maximum period of detention. It is true that Parlia- ment cannot fetter its own hands in the matters of legislating with regard to the maximum period of detention. If the Parliament can fix the maximum period it can also alter it. But if the maximum period so fixed is unreasonably long Art. 19(1) would be attracted. An harmo- nious construction of the whole of Articles 22(4) and 22(7) would thus necessitate that Parliament should provide a maximum period of detention not merely in respect of laws relating to preventive detention made by State Legislatures but also its own laws regarding preventive detention. If legislation with regard to the provision of a maximum period is merely optional there was no need for the proviso at all. The fact that only sub- clause (b) of clause (7) is mentioned in the proviso to Article 22(4) (a) does not make any difference to the obligatory character of having a maximum period for preventive detention because, as we have already seen, fixing of maximum period of detention is obligatory under Article 22(7) (a) and (b). It can also be said that where Parliament has prescribed the maximum period of detention under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7) such a maximum would be automatically attracted to the proviso under Article 22(4) (a). Furthermore, sub-clause (a) of clause (7) is not mentioned in the, proviso to sub-clause (4) (a) because Article 22(4) does not deal with detention without the opinion of an Advisory Board. That is why clause (b) alone is mentioned. It is clear that the concept of a maxi- mum period of detention runs through the whole of Article 22(4) and (7). This is because while Parliament and State Legislatures make laws it is the executive that makes orders of detention and if no maximum period of detention is specified by law it would be open to the executive to keep persons in detention indefinitely. It is not reason-able to hold that the Constitution makers while providing that if a person is to be detained without the opinion of an Advisory Board being taken there should be a maximum period of detention, thought tha\r\n', 'ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition Nos. 41, 106 etc. etc. of 1973.\r\n\r\nUnder Art. 32 of the Constitution for issue of a writ in the nature of habeas corpus.\r\n\r\nR.

In these writ petitions filed under article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners question the legality of their detente and pray for issue of writs in the nature of habeas corpus. These petitions raise a common constitutional question, namely, whether Parliament is bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22(7)(b) of the Constitution in order that the proviso to article 22(4)(e) might operate, and, whether, by s. 13 of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 (Act 26 of 1971), hereinafter referred to as the Act, after it was amended by s. 6(d) of the Defence of India Act, 1971, the Parliament has prescribed the \"maximum period\". The orders passed by the Government of West Bengal under s.12 (1) of the Act in these cases provide that the Governor is-pleased to confirm the orders of detention and to continue the detention of the detenues till the expiration of 12 months from the dates of their detention of until the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, whichever is later.\r\n\r\nThe material part of s. 13 of the Act as it originally stood ran as follows :\r\n\r\n\"The maximum period for which any person may be detained in pursuance of any detention order which has been confirmed under s. 12 shall be twelve months from the date of detention.\"\r\nAfter it was amended by s. 6(d) of the Defence of India Act, 1971, the material part of s. 13 of the Act reads \"The maximum period for which any person may be detained it% pursuance of any detention order which has been confirmed under s. 12 shall be twelve months from the date of detention or until the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, whichever is later.\"\r\nThe Defence of India Act, 1971, came into force on December 4, 1971. Section 1(3) of that Act provides that the Act shall come into force at once and shall remain in force during the period of operation of the Proclamation of Emergency and for a period of six months thereafter. Section 2(g) of that Act defines \"Proclamation of Emergency\" as the proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 352 of the Constitution on the 3rd day of December, 1971. The President issued the Proclamation of Emergency under article 352 of the Constitution on December 3, 1971. Article 22(4)(a) of the Constitution says that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a period longer then three months unless an Advisory Board has reported before the expiry of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention. The proviso to the article provides that nothing in sub-clause (a) shall authorize, the detention of any person \"beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause (7)\" of article 22. By reason of article 22 (4) (b), a person can be detained for a longer period than three months without the necessity of consulting an Advisory Board if \"such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses\r\n\r\n(a) and (b) of clause (7)\" of article 22. And, article 22(7) says \"(7) Parliament may by law prescribe-\r\n\r\n(a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of subclause (a) of clause (4);\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention; and\r\n\r\n(c)the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4).\"\r\n\r\nThe contentions of the petitioners were that the Parliament was bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b) of the Constitution in order that the, proviso to article 22(4) (a) might operate and, as S. 13 of the Act as amended did not prescribe \"the maximum period\" of detention, the confirmation of the detention orders in terms of s. 13 of the Act was bad.\r\n\r\nThe learned Attorney General, who appeared for the respondent in these petitions, submitted that in s. 13 of the Act the parliament has prescribed \"the maximum period\" of detention. And in the alter-\r\n\r\nnative, he said that the Parliament was not. bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention for the proviso to article 22(4)(a) to operate.\r\n\r\nin A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras(1) Kania, C. J. said that article 22(7) (b) is permissive, it being not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe the maximum period and that if this construction resulted in a Parliamentary law enabling the detention of a person for an indefinite period without trial, that unfortunate consequence is the result of the words of article 22(7) itself and that the Court could do nothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn Krishnan v. The State of Madras(2), s. 11 of the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, was impugned as violative of article 22 (4) (a) on the ground that S. 11 did not fix a maximum period of detention, but on the contrary, empowered the Government in express terms to order that the detenu was to continue in detention for such period as it thought fit. The Court, by a majority, held that s.11 was not invalid on the ground that it did not fix the maximum period of detention inasmuch as the Act was to be in force only for a period of one year and no detention under that Act could be continued after the expiry of the Act. Mahajan, J. pointed out that the point was concluded by the decision in Gopalan\'s case(1) where Kania, C.J. had observed that it was not obligatory on Parliament to\' prescribe any maximum period. On the other hand, Bose, J. who wrote a dissenting judgment, held that though it was not obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention under article 22(7)(b), if it wanted to detain a person for a period longer than three months, it could only do so by providing in the Act the maximum period of detention. In the State of West Bengal v. Ashok Dey and Others(3) the central issue was whether a State Legislature has power to pass a law providing for preventive detention of a person for a period longer than three months even after obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board that there was sufficient cause for detention, unless the Parliament has prescribed the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). The contention was that there was no such power. The Court negatived the contention and said that article 22(7) is couched in, a permissive way, that there is nothing mandatory about it and that the majority decision in Krishnan\'s case(2) following the observation of Kania, C.J. in Gopalan\'s case(3) was binding on the, Court. The Court also said that under entry 3 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, both Parliament and State legislatures have concurrent power to make laws in respect of \"preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a State, the maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; persons subject to such detention\", and that as the State legislatures have plenary power to make- law providing for preventive, detention within the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the power must necessarily extend to all (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88, (2) [1951] S.C.R. 621 (3) [1972] 1 S.C.C. 199.\r\n\r\nmatters incidental to preventive detention as contemplated by this entry subject only to the condition that the law made by the State should not come into conflict with a law made by Parliament with respect to the same matter. The Court came to the conclusion that there was no limitation on the power of a State legislature to make a law providing for detention for a period beyond three months for the reason that Parliament has not made a law prescribing the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). Great reliance was placed by the petitioners on the reasoning contained in the dissenting judgment of Bose, J. in Krishnan\'s case (supra) for the proposition that the fixation by law of the maximum period of detention is obligatory upon Parliament in order that the proviso to article 22 (4) (a) may operate.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bose, J., a law providing for detention of a person beyond a period of three months must satisfy either clause (4) (a) or clause (4) (b) of article 22. The learned judge was not, however, prepared to read the word \'may\' in clause (7) of article 22 as meaning must\' as that would change the usual meaning of the word. He was of the view that Parliament is free to prescribe or not to prescribe the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b) and that neither Parliament nor State legislature can be compelled to pass a law authorising preventive detention beyond three months but, if, however, either wishes to do so, then it is bound to conform to the provisions of either sub-clause (a) or (b) of article 22(4) or both, and that, in the case, of sub-clause (a), the proviso is as much a part of the sub-clause as its main provision. The learned judge then said that if no maximum limit is prescribed under sub- clause (b) of article 22(7), the proviso to article 22 (4)\r\n\r\n(a) cannot operate, and, if it cannot operate, no legisla- tive action can be taken under clause (4) (a), and resorted to reasoning from analogies to fortify his conclusion. He observed : \"\'If A is told by B that he may go to a bank and withdraw a sum of money not exceeding such limit as may be fixed by C, it is evident that until C fixes the limit no money can be withdrawn. Equally, if A is told that he may withdraw money not exceeding a limit which he himself may fix, there can, in my opinion, be no right of withdrawal until he fixes the limit\". He concluded his judgment by saying that the majority judgment amounted to the Constitution telling all persons resident in the land that \"though we authorise Parliament to prescribe a maximum limit of detention if it so chooses, we place no compulsion on it to do so and we authorise it to pass legislation which will empower any person or authority Parliament chooses to name, right down to, a police constable, to arrest you and detain you as long as he pleases, for the duration of your life if he wants, so that you may linger and rot in jail. till you die, as did men in the Bastille\".\r\n\r\nWe think the analogies which the learned judge referred to are, In fact, misleading and his seasonings from them not convincing.\r\n\r\nUnder entry 3 of List III of the Seventh Schedule, both Parliament and State legislatures have plenary power to pass laws for preventive detention as respects the subjects mentioned therein. As ancillary to that power, or, as an inseparable part of it. Parliament and State legislatures have power to fix the period of detention also. One cannot imagine a power to pass a law for detention unless that power carries with it the incidental power to provide for the period of such detention. Therefore, both Parliament and State legislatures have power under the entry to provide for detention of a person for a specified period. the purpose of article 22 (4) (a) is to put a curb on that power by provid- ing that no law shall authorize the detention,of a person for a period exceeding three months unless an Advisory board has reported within the period of three months that there is sufficient cause for detention. And, what the proviso means is that even if the Advisory Board has reported before the expiration of three months that there is sufficient cause for detention, the period of detention beyond three months shall not exceed the maximum period that might be fixed by any law made by Parliament under article 22(7) (b). The proviso cannot mean that even if Parliament does not pass a law fixing the maximum period under article 22 (7) (b), the State legislatures, for example, cannot pass a law which provides for detention of a person beyond three months. The period of such detention,, viz., detention beyond the period of three months, would then be a matter within the plenary power of Parliament or State legislatures, as the case may be, as such a power is incidental to the power to pass a law with respect to the topics covered by entry 3 of List III. It is therefore clear that, but for the proviso to clause (4) (a) of article 22, the Act, as it provides for the opinion of the Advisory Board, can authorize detention of a person for any period, by virtue of the plenary character of the legislative power conferred by the entry. Whether such a law is liable to be struck down on the ground that it imposes unreasonable restrictions upon the fundamental rights under article 19 is an altogether different question. The proviso says in effect that if Parliament fixes the maximum period under article 22(7) (b), the power of Parliament and State legislatures to fix the period of detention in a law passed under the entry would be curtailed to that extent.\r\n\r\nSeeing, therefore, that the power to pass a law providing for detention of a person after obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board includes the power to fix any reasonable period beyond three months by virtue of the plenary character of the legislative power conferred by the entry, the proper analogy would be : A has authority from B to draw any amount from a bank but he is told that if C fixes a limit upon that authority then be can only draw the amount as fixed by C, in such a case. if C does not fix the amount the power of A to draw is plenary. Or, if A is told that he may withdraw money not exceeding a limit which he himself may fix. A has power to draw any amount, nay, the whole amount in the Bank, if only he fixes the limit at that amount. The condition-precedent, namely. the fixation of the amount by A in such a case, would be wholly illusory, for whatever be chooses to draw would be the limit of his authority. To put it differently, as Parliament and State legislatures have power under the entry to pass a law enabling the detention of a person for a period longer than three months in case the law provides for the opinion of the Advisory Board, there could be no limit to that period, except in the context of its reasonableness, as the power to fix the period of detention is incidental to the plenary power to legislate on the topic of preventive detention. The proviso merely enables Parliament to put a curb on that power by prescribing the maximum period of detention under article 22 (7) (b). The proviso does not, proprio vigore, compel the Parliament to fix the maximum period. Nor does article 22(7). On the other hand, it expressly says otherwise. Whence then arises the obligation of Parliament to fix the maximum period under article 22 (7) (b) ? We see no provision which either expressly or by necessary implication compels Parliament to do so. Personal liberty is a cherished freedom, more cherished perhaps than all other freedoms, and we are deeply concerned that no man may linger and rot in detention. As judges and citizens., personal liberty is as dear to us as to anyone else and we may respectfully venture to make the same assumption in regard to those judges who were parties to the decisions in Gopalan\'s case(1), Krishnan\'s case(2) and Ashok Dey\'s case(3). But the problem here is one of dispassionate interpretation of the article in question and we cannot import an obligation that Parliament \"shall\" by law prescribe the maximum period of detention. Such an obligation could only arise from an invisible, radiation proceeding from a vague and speculative concept of personal liberty. The language\' of article 22(4(b) is in marked contrast with that of article 22 (4) (a) read with the proviso. Article 22(4) (b) makes it obligatory upon Parliament, if it wants to pass a law for detaining a person for a period of more than three months without making a provision in that law for obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board within three months. to comply with sub- clauses (a) and (b) of article 22(7). We, therefore, see no sufficient reason for departing from the view taken in the decisions of this Court referred to earlier as regards the power of Parliament under article 22(7) (b). The question whether, when Parliament passes a law under article 22(7) (b) fixing the maximum period of detention in any class of cases, it is exercising an independent power of fixing the maximum period of detention derived from clause (7) of article 22 or a power traceable to the entries on the subject of preventive detention, does not arise for consideration here. If the exercise of the power under article 22(7) is independent of the power conferred by the entries relating to preventive detention, the question whether a law passed by virtue of any of the entries fixing a period of detention in excess of the maximum period fixed by a law passed under article 22 (7) (b) would, sub-silentio repeal the provision in regard to the maximum period in the law passed under article 22(7), and make that period \"the maximum period\" for the purpose of article, 22(7) (b) does not also strictly arise for consideration. But this much we think is certain, namely, that the prescription of a \'maximum period\' by a law made under article 22(7) (b) has no particular sanctity so far as Parliament is concerned, as it could pass a law for detention the (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. (2) [1951] S.C.R. 621. (3) [1972] 1 S.C.C. 199.\r\n\r\nnext day providing for a higher \'maximum period\' and justify that law as a law passed both under the relevant entry relating \'to preventive detention and under article 22 (7)\r\n\r\n(b). To put it differently, the, view that the prescription of the maximum period under article 22(7)(b) is a guarantee that the Parliament cannot pass a law providing for longer period of detention than the maximum period fixed under article 22(7)(b) has no solid foundation, as the law of detention fixing the longer period would sub silentio repeal the law under article 22(7)(b) fixing the \'maximum period\'. As Parliament has power to repeal a law fixing the maximum period under article 22(7)(b), the longer period fixed under the later law of detention would become the maximum period.\r\n\r\nDetention without trial is a serious matter. It is only natural that it should conjure up lurid pictures of men pining in Bastille. But malignant diseases call for drastic remedies. And it was this realization that made the Constitution-makers-all lovers of liberty-to reconcile themselves to the idea of detention without trial. Even if it is granted that Parliament is bound to fix the maximum period of detention, as we said, such a fixation cannot be immutable. what then is the great guarantee of personal liberty in the fixation of the maximum period of detention by Parliament, if that fixation can fluctuate with the mood of Parliament ?\r\n\r\nThe learned Attorney General contended in the alternative that if S. 13 as amended is regarded as fixing the maximum period of detention under article 22(7) (b), it does not suffer from any infirmity on the score that the period fixed is indefinite as contended by the petitioners. The petitioners bad contended that the expression \"the maximum period\" occurring in article 22(7) (b) connotes a definite period reckoned in terms of years, months or days and that no period can be said to be a maximum period unless it is possible to predicate its beginning and end in terms of years, months or days. In other words, the argument was that since the determination of the period of detention, namely, the expiry of the Defence of India Act, 1971, is de- pendent upon the revocation of the Proclamation of Emergency, the period fixed in S. 13 is not \"the maximum period\" as visualized by article 22 (7) (b). The meaning of the word \'maximum\' is, \"the highest attainable magnitude or quantity (of some thing), a superior limit\" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary, p. 1221, (1953), 3rd ed.). The meaning of the word \'period\' is \" A course or extent of time; Time of duration\" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary, p. 1474). Therefore, the words \"maximum period\" mean the highest or greatest course or extent or stretch of time. The highest or greatest course or extent or stretch of time may be measured in terms of years, months or days, as well as in terms of the occurrence of an event or the continuous of a state of affairs.\r\n\r\nIn Juggilal Kamlapat v. Collector, Bombay(1), the High Court of Bombay was concerned with the question whether a requisition (1) A.I.R. 1946 Bombay 280.\r\n\r\nder which stated that the requisition of the immovable property in question was to continue during the period of \"the, present war and x months thereafter\" was vague and indefinite. Bhagwati, J. said \"The period of the present war through indefinite in duration was definite in itself in so far as the petitioners were given in as clear terms as it could be an indication of the period for which their property was sought to be requisitioned by respondent 1 viz., the duration of the present war. The user of this term was as definite as the user of the ex-\r\n\r\npression \"the life time of A\" which is used when settling or bequeathing a remainder in favour of B. B could not be heard to say that the life time of A which was the period prescribed as the one which was to come to an end before the remainder would vest in possession in his favour was a term which was vague or indefinite. It was as clear and definite as it could be, having regard to the fact that the period of the life time of an individual is indeterminate, though that life is of necessity going to come to an end some time or other\".\r\n\r\nWe do not think it necessary that Parliament should have fixed a period in terms of years, months or days in order that it might be \"the maximum period\" for the purpose of article 2Z(7) (b). Seeing that the object of the law of preventive detention is to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of internal security, or of public order, or of supplies and services essential to the community or other objects specified in entry 9 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, we see great force in the contention of the learned Attorney General that \"the maximum period\" in article 22(7) (b) can be fixed with reference to the duration of an emergency. In other words, as the object of preventive detention is to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of internal security, public order or supplies or services essential to the community or other objects specified in entry 9 of List I, the power to detain must be adequate in point of duration to achieve the object. And, how can the power be adequate in point of duration, if it is insufficient to cope with an emergency created by war or public disorder or shortage of supplies essential to the community, the duration of which might be incapable of being predicted in terms of years, months or days even by those gifted with great prophetic vision ? If \'the maximum period\" can be fixed only in terms of years, months or days, certainly it would have been open to Parliament to fix a long period in S. 13 and justify it as \"the maximum period\". It would be straining the gnat and swallowing the camel if anybody is shocked by the fixation of the maximum period of detention with reference to the duration of an emergency but could stomach with complacency the fixation of maximum period, say, at fifteen or twenty years. Whether the fixation of a \"maximum period\" in terms of years or in terms of events is reasonable in a particular circumstance, is a totally different matter. it was argued on behalf of one of the interveners on the basis of the decision of this Court in B. Shama Rao v. The Union Territory of Pondicherry(1) that the Parliament has abdicated its power al. duty to fix maximum period to the executive as the determination the duration of the Proclamation of the Emergency is a matter with the discretion of the President and he is, therefore, the authority to determine the retirement age of the Defence of India Act. We do not think that the Parliament, in fixing the duration of the maximum period of detention with reference to an event like the cessation of the period of emergency, has, in any way, abdicated its power or function to fix the maximum period or delegated it to the President. There can be no doubt that it is Parliament that has fixed the maximum period in S. 13 of the Act. The only question is whether, because the duration of the period is dependent upon the volition of the President, it ceases to be \"the maximum period\". We cannot presume that the President will act unreasonably and continue the Proclamation of Emergency even after the emergency has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners argued that s. 13 of the Act is bad for the reason that it is violative of their fundamental right under article 19 of the Constitution. This challenge is not open to them as it is precluded by the Proclamation of Emergency. Although it was argued that s. 13 of the Act is violative of article 14 of the Constitution for the reason that it has conferred unlimited discretion on the detaining authority to fix the period of detention, we do not think that there is any substance in that contention. The authority which passes the initial order of detention is not expected to fix the period of detention [see Krishnan\'s case(supra)], nay, it may be illegal if it were to do so. Nor is the Government bound, when confirming the order of detention, under s. 12(1) of the Act, to fix the period of detention [see Suna Ullah v. State of J N K(2). Even if a period is fixed in confirming the detention order under S. 12(1), the period can be revoked or modified (see s. 13). The maximum period of detention has been fixed by s. 13 and the discretion to fix the duration within the maximum has been given to the Government after considering all the relevant circumstances. Seeing that the maximum period of detention has been fixed by S. 13 and that the discretion to fix the period of detention in a particular case has to be exercised after taking into account a number of imponderable circumstances, we do not think that there is any substance in the argument that the power of Government to determine the period of detention is discriminatory or arbitrary. In the result, we overrule the contention of the petitioners and direct the writ petitions to be listed for disposal. ALAGIRISWAMI, J. I have read the judgment of our learned brother Mathew, J. and with respect I differ from him on the question whether it is obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention. I shall analyse the relevant provisions later but I shall first deal with three decisions which have dealt with this question.\r\n\r\n(1) [1967] 2 S.C.R. 650.\r\n\r\n(2) A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 2431.\r\n\r\nIn A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras(1) the six learned Judges comprising the Bench delivered separate judgments. Kania C. J. was the only Judge who dealt with this point in these words :\r\n\r\n\"It was argued that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely. If that construction is correct, it springs out of the words of sub- clause (7) itself and the Court cannot help in the matter.\"\r\nIt would be noticed that there is no discussion at all here as to whether the learned Chief Justice came to the conclusion that the contention was correct or not or how it springs out of the words of subclause (7) that it was not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe any maximum period.\r\nIn the next case of S. Krishnan v. The State of Madras(2) Patanjali Sastri, J. with whom Kania, C.J. agreed, did not deal with this question at all. Mahajan, J., with whom S. R. Das, J. agreed substantially on the grounds stated by Mahajan, J. did, of course, deal with this question in these words : \"The next point canvassed before us was that the Constitution does not envisage detention for an indefinite period and that it is obligatory on Parliament to provide a maximum period for detention of a person under a law of preventive detention. In my opinion, this argument again is not sound. Emphasis was laid on the proviso to article 22(4) (a) which enacts that nothing in the sub-clause shall authorize the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause(b)of clause (7)and it was urged that the, word \"may\" in article 22(7) must be read in the sense of \"must\" and as having a compulsory force inasmuch as the enactment authorizes Parlia- ment to prescribe by law a maximum period for detention, for the advancement of justice and for public good, or for the benefit of persons subjected to preventive detention. Reference was made to Maxwell on \"Interpretation of the Statutes\" (9th End., page 246) and to the well-known case of Julius v. Bishop of Oxford(3) Lord Cairns in that case observed as follows :-\r\n\"Where a power is deposited with a public officer for the purpose of being used for the benefit of persons that power ought to be exercised.\"\r\nIn my opinion, clause (7) of article 22, as already pointed out, in its true concept to a certain degree restricts the measure of the fundamental right contained in clause (4) (a) and in this context the rule referred to by Maxwell has no application whatever. Moreover, the provision in the Constitution is merely an enabling one and it is well settled (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. (2) [1951] S.C.R.\r\n621. (3) 5 App. cas. 214.\r\nthat in an enabling Act words of a permissive nature cannot be given a compulsory meaning. (Vide Caries on Statute Law, p. 254). Be that as it may, the point is no longer open as it has been concluded by the majority decision in Gopalan\'s case. The learned Chief Justice at p. 119 of the report observed as follows :- \"Sub-clause (b) is permissive. It is not obligatory on the Parliament to prescribe any maximum period. It was argued that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely. If that construction is correct, it springs out of the words of subclause (7) itself and the court cannot help in the matter.\"\r\nNothing said by Mr. Nambiar is sufficient to persuade me to take a different view of the matter than was taken in Gopalan\'s case. It may be pointed out that Parliament may well have thought that it was unnecessary to fix any maximum period of detention in the statute which was of a temporary nature and whose own tenure of life was limited to one, year. Such temporary statutes cease to have any effect after they expire, they automatically come to an end at the expiry of the period for which they have been enacted and nothing further can be done under them. The detention of the petitioners therefore is bound to come to an end automatically with the life of the statute and in these circumstances Parliament may well have thought that it would be wholly unnecessary to legislate and provide a maximum period of detention for those detained tinder this law.\"\r\nIt would be noticed that while he did discuss this question he thought that the point was concluded by the decision in Gopalan\'s case. As I have pointed out earlier that was not a majority decision but only a passing observation by Kania, C.J. Both these cases mainly proceed on the basis that the Act itself being a temporary Act to be in force for a year the question of maximum period did not arise for serious consideration. Bose, J. however was of the view that it was obligatory on Parliament to fix the maximum period of detention.\r\nIn the latest case of State of West Bengal v. Ashok Dey(1), which was a judgment by four learned Judges, Dua, J. speaking for the Court said :\r\n\"Now, the argument raised in the High Court and accepted by it and repeated before us by Shri S. N. Chatterji on behalf of the respondents is that clause (7) (b) of Article 22 makes it obligatory for the Parliament to prescribe by law the maximum period for which a person may be detained as also the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board in holding the enquiry under clause (4) (a) of this Article. According to the submission, in the absence of such a law by Parliament no order of detention can authorise detention of any person for a period longer than three months and at the (1) [1972] (1) S.C.C. 199.\r\nexpiry of three months all persons detained under the Act must be released.\r\nWe are unable to accept this construction of clause (7) of Article 22. It is noteworthy that Shri Chatterji, learned counsel for the respondents, expressly conceded before us that Article 22(7) is only an enabling or a permissive provision and it does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Parliament to make a law prescribing the circumstances under which a person may be detained for more than three months as stated therein. But according to him sub-clause (b) and (c) of clause (7) do contain a mandate to the Parliament which is obligatory. In our view, clause (7) of this Article on its plain reading merely authorises or enables the Parliament to make a law prescribing (i) the circumstances under which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months, (ii) the maximum period for which a person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention, and (iii) the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board in an enquiry under clause (4) (a) of this Article. The respondents\' contention that \"may\" in the opening part of this Article must be read as \"shall\" in respect of sub-clauses (b) and (c) though it retains its normal permissive character in so far as clause (a) is concerned, in the absence of special compelling reasons can be supported neither on principle nor by precedent of which we are aware. On the other hand this Court has in S. Krishnan v. State of Madras agreeing with the observations of Kania, C.J. in Gopalan v. State of Madras held sub-clause (b) of clause (7) to be permissive. This opinion is not only binding on us but we are also in respectful agreement with it.\"\r\nThis decision does directly deal with the point but not by detailed analysis of the relevant provisions as done by Mathew, J. and Bhagwati, J. and as I have tried to do later on. The decision, however, war. mainly concerned with the power of the State Legislature to make a law with regard to preventive detention and the whole approach is coloured by this consideration rather than the question whether the prescription of the maximum is obligatory. The power of Parliament to legislate with regard to preventive detention arises under Entry 9, List 1 of the Seventh Schedule as well as Entry 3, List 3 of the Seventh Schedule. The State Legislature has the power to legislate with regard to preventive detention under Entry 3 in List 3 of the Seventh Schedule. This, of course, is subject to the provisions of Article 254(2) of the Constitution. Article 22 is found in Part III of the Constitution regarding fundamental rights. According to Article 1 3 (2) the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the, rights conferred by that Part. Therefore, Article 22 is an article restricting the powers of Parliament and State Legislatures in regard to preventive detention in the manner laid down therein. Of the learned Judges who dealt with Gopalan\'s case. Kania, C.J., Patanjali Sastri and Dass JJ. took the view that Article 22 does not 4-L748SuP. CI/74 form a complete code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention. While Mahajan, J, thought that it contains a self contained code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention, Das, J. thought that Article 22 lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even the Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. Mukherjea, J. proceeded to state his conclusions on the assumption that Art. 22 is not a self-contained code relating to preventive detention. Fazl Ali, J. took the view that Art. 22 does not form an exhaustive code by its,-If relating to preventive detention. All this goes to show that all the learned Judges more or less took the view that Art. 22 obtained certain constitutional safeguards regarding the preventive detention.\r\n\r\nNow let us took at Article 22 in so far as it is necessary for purpose of this discussion : \"Art. 22(4) No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless--\r\n\r\n(a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause (7); or\r\n\r\n(b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under subclauses (a) and (b) of clause (7).\r\n\r\n(7) Parliament may by law prescribe-\r\n\r\na) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4);\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention; and\r\n\r\n(c) I shall now place the various parts of the above provisions separately so as to make matters clear :\r\n\r\n1. No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless the Advisory Board, consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be the appointed as Judges of the High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention. This does not authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause\r\n\r\n3. No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a period longer than three months unless such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parlia- ment prescribing\r\n\r\n(a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a _period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4); (and)\r\n\r\n(b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention.\r\n\r\nThe 1st proposition means that a law providing for preventive detention can authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months only if an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention.\r\n\r\nProposition (2) means that even with the advice of an Advisory Board the detention cannot exceed the maximum period prescribed by law made by Parliament under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) of clause (7). I shall deal with the question whether it is obligatory on Parliament to make such a law a little later.\r\n\r\nProposition (3) means that if a person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7) the detention can be for a period longer than three months. It should be noticed that the law contemplated under this proposition is one made under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). Therefore a Parliamentary statute can provide for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board by laying down the circumstances under which and class or classes of cases on which it can be done. In that case the maximum period for which a person can be detained should also be specified by the parliamentary law i.e. a person cannot be detained for a period exceeding three months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board unless tile concerned provision of law also provides for the maximum period for which such a person is to be detained. The Constitution makers have Contemplated that if the Advisory Board\'s opinion is to be dispensed with, the maximum period of detention should be laid down. it is obvious, therefore, that the word \"may\" in Art. 22(7) amounts to `shall\". It is also obvious that the power to dispense with the opinion of an Advisory Board is given only to Parliament. When it makes a law under clause (7) (a) & (b) of Art. 22 that also would bind the State Legislatures in so far as they enact any legislation with regard to preventive detention. This is not, of course, to say that State Legislatures have no power with regard to preventive detention. But they do not have the power to prescribe the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than 3 months without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board. That power is completely that of Parliament and any State legislation will also be subject to the maximum period prescribed by Parliament under a legislation made under Art. 22(7) (a) and (b). The only question that now remains to be considered is whether if an Advisory Board is provided for in a law providing for preventive detention under Article 22(4) a maximum period of detention should be prescribed or not. In considering this question one thing would be obvious : that if Parliament does prescribe a maximum period under proposition (2) i.e. the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a), that would apply to all laws relating to preventive detention whether made by Parliament or by a State Legislature. Apparently the power to prescribe, a maximum period given to Parliament (referred to in this proviso) is to prevent the State Legislatures making laws with regard to preventive detention without any maximum limit. This is another limitation on the powers of the State Legislature to legislate with regard to preventive detention. The Constitution makers apparently did not want the State Legislatures to have an unfettered power with regard to preventive detention even in the field allotted to them under Entry 3 of List 3 of Seventh Schedule. This provision can be usefully compared with the provision of Art. 31(3) which provides for a legislation made under the provisions of clause, (2) of Art. 31 being reserved for consideration of the President and receiving his assent in order that it may have effect. This was intended to act as a fetter on the power of the State Legislatures to legislate under the provisions of Art. 31(2). The only difference between Art. 31(3) and the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a) is that in the one case the power is given to the President and in the other case the power is given to the Parliament. Now if under subclauses (a) and (b) of clause (7), read together, Parliament has to prescribe the maximum period of detention, does the fact that the proviso to Art. 22(4) (a) mentions only sub-clause (b) of clause (7) but not also sub-clause\r\n\r\n(a), makes any difference ? If, as I have already pointed out, this proviso at least contemplates Parliament making a law providing for the maximum period of detention which cannot be exceeded by any State law regarding preventive detention the reasonable construction would be to hold that it is obligatory on Parliament to legislate under sub-clause\r\n\r\n(b) fettering the hands of the State Legislature in regard to the maximum period of detention. It is true that Parlia- ment cannot fetter its own hands in the matters of legislating with regard to the maximum period of detention. If the Parliament can fix the maximum period it can also alter it. But if the maximum period so fixed is unreasonably long Art. 19(1) would be attracted. An harmo- nious construction of the whole of Articles 22(4) and 22(7) would thus necessitate that Parliament should provide a maximum period of detention not merely in respect of laws relating to preventive detention made by State Legislatures but also its own laws regarding preventive detention. If legislation with regard to the provision of a maximum period is merely optional there was no need for the proviso at all. The fact that only sub- clause (b) of clause (7) is mentioned in the proviso to Article 22(4) (a) does not make any difference to the obligatory character of having a maximum period for preventive detention because, as we have already seen, fixing of maximum period of detention is obligatory under Article 22(7) (a) and (b). It can also be said that where Parliament has prescribed the maximum period of detention under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7) such a maximum would be automatically attracted to the proviso under Article 22(4) (a). Furthermore, sub-clause (a) of clause (7) is not mentioned in the, proviso to sub-clause (4) (a) because Article 22(4) does not deal with detention without the opinion of an Advisory Board. That is why clause (b) alone is mentioned. It is clear that the concept of a maxi- mum period of detention runs through the whole of Article 22(4) and (7). This is because while Parliament and State Legislatures make laws it is the executive that makes orders of detention and if no maximum period of detention is specified by law it would be open to the executive to keep persons in detention indefinitely. It is not reason-able to hold that the Constitution makers while providing that if a person is to be detained without the opinion of an Advisory Board being taken there should be a maximum period of detention, thought tha\r\n', NULL, '8822285656', '0', NULL, 24, NULL, 'Civil Procedure', 9, NULL, 'test civil procedure', NULL, '1', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-02');

The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy.

Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel.

Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Sections 302</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">304</a>&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 304B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 302</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 302</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 304B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>&nbsp;will be complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 201</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/240425/\">In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram</a>&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 304B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. In that case, the funeral was conducted in the wee hours. In this case, funeral was conducted in the evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. From all this, it is clear that the prosecution has not only proved the offence under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 304B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>&nbsp;with the aid of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 113B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1953529/\">Indian Evidence Act</a>&nbsp;but also the offence under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 201</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>. We are satisfied that all the three ingredients of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439698/\">Section 304B</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1569253/\">IPC</a>, they being:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) that the death of a woman has been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b)&nbsp;that such death has been caused or has occurred within seven years of her marriage; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c)&nbsp;that soon before her death the woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand for dowry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>as also the presumption under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1906/\">Section 113B</a>&nbsp;of India Evidence Act are fully established the case of prosecution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. We have gone through the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the appellate Court carefully and we find that both the Courts have fully considered all the aspects of this matter. We, therefore, find nothing wrong with the judgments and confirm the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.......................................J.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(V.S. Sirpurkar) ......................................J.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Dr. Mukundakam Sharma) New Delhi;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 29, 2010</p>\r\n', '<p>V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B, Indian Penal Code (IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under Section 201, IPC and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under Sections 302, 304 B and 201 IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under Section 304B, IPC and Section, 201, IPC was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under Section 302, IPC though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under Section 302, IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could i</p>\r\n', NULL, '1000086', '2', NULL, 1, NULL, 'Constitutional  Law', 1, NULL, 'Noise Pollution', '', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '1', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-02');

It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients.

However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/654536/\">Forest Act</a>. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tribunal further observed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous. No costs.</p>\r\n', '<p>J U D G M E N T ARUN KUMAR, J....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forest service in the State of Orissa was constituted under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Madras Forest Act, 1882. However, in 1972 the State had its own Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid</p>\r\n', NULL, '1000097', '2', '', 3, NULL, 'Merchantile Law', 1, NULL, 'Noise Pollution', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, '1', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-02'),

In the course of the hearing the respondent claimed that the G.K. Hospital, Building item No. (3) was also exempt from liability to gift-tax because of s. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv) of the Gift-tax. Act.

The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;.

A few months after the deed of gift his son Thomas also qualified to be a medical practitioner. But there is nothing in the deed of gift which even remotely suggests that the gift was made by the respondent in the course of his profession and bona fide for the purpose of carrying on his profession as a practitioner in medicine. The recitals in the deed are clear : it is recited in the deed that the gift was made &#39;out of love and affection&quot;. There was no evidence before the taxing authorities that the gift was made to the donee Thomas in the course of carrying on the business by the donor or for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The Tribunal observed in paragraph-7 of the judgement :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;There is no finding that the assessee has ceased to carry on his profession as a doctor; Therefore it will be clear that the gift had been made in the course of the carrying on the profession. Now the next condition is that it should have been made for the purpose of the profession.

The High Court observed:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;We feel it difficult to resist the conclusion that in the background and circumstances, the gift could well be regarded as having been made for the better ordering of the business of the assessee......... it would be enough to show that the gift was made on grounds of commercial expediency and in order to directly or indirectly facilitate the carrying on of the business, profession or vocation.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We are unable to agree with the views so expressed.

It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question is really one of interpretation of two important provisions relating to the computation of business income for purposes of income tax. We may start with the provisions of the Indian lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as the &#39;1922 Act&#39;). The computation of business income for purposes of income tax was done in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the said Act. In the process of making such computation, the Act provided for two important deductions (among others), in respect of the capital assets employed in the business. The first was the deduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance in respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant or furniture being the property of the assessee and used for the purposes of the business, at a prescribed percentage of the written down value of such assets. This allowance is calculated, in respect of the year of acquisition of the property, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee and in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of the actual cost less the depreciation allowances granted in the preceding years. In strict principle, this is an allowance of capital nature but it is now well settled that the allowance of depreciation has to be taken into account in order to ascertain the true profits of a business and, therefore, an assessee is permitted to deduct, in the computation of the business income year after year, the prescribed percentage of the value of the assets used for the purposes of business. The second allowance was not there in the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income- tax (Amendment) Act, 1946. The introduction was of certain allowances in respect of expenditure on. &quot;scientific research related to the business&quot;, an expression which was defined in a fairly comprehensive manner by the statute. Three types of allowances were permitted in respect of this category of expenditure of which we are here concerned with only one. This provision was contained in clause (xiv) of S.10(2) which permitted a deduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business, an allowance for each of the Five consecutive previous year. beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred, or where the expenditure was incurred prior to the commencement of the business, for each of the five consecutive previous years beginning with the year in which the business was commenced, equal 2to one-fifth of such expenditure: Provided that no allowance shall be made for any expenditure incurred more than three years before the commencement of the business: A Provided further that-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>XXX XXX XXX</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(d) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this clause in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by any asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clause (vi) or clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(vii) for the same previous year in respect of that asset;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(e) where an asset is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business, and a claim for an allowance under clause (vi) or clause (vii) is made in respect of that asset, the actual cost to the assessee of the asset shall be treated as reduced by the amount of any deductions allowed under this clause;&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A cursory and conjoint reading of section 10(2) (vi) and section 10(2) (xiv) suggests that where an assessee incurs expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business and the expenditure results in the acquisition of an asset, the assessee can claim, under clause (vi), a deduction of the specified percentage of the written down value of the asset and under clause</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years, of the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the asset. For this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used for scientific research related to the business is also ipso facto an asset used for the purpose of business. There has been some debate before us as to whether this is always so but we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes of the present case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will at once be seen that, if these two provisions are applied simultaneously, it would result in granting an assessee a double allowance in respect of the same expenditure - one of the entire amount over a period of 5 years and the other a percentage of the expenditure over a number . consecutive years at a graded scale as already mentioned. The question at once leaps to the mind as to whether it could have been the intention of the legislature to permit both these deductions simultaneously to an assessee. The provisions of clauses (d) and (e) of the proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) contain a clue to answer this question. More about it later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We next turn to the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic of depreciation is dealt with by section 32. Section 32(1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is allowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain capital assets employed in the bussiness. The topic of scientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35. Section 35(1) provides for the deduction of four types of expenditure on scientific research and what we are concerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv), which is to the following effect:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iv) in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee, such deduction as may be admissible under the provisions of sub- section (2).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Sub-section (2) provides that, for the purposes of clause (iv)of sub-section (1), one-fifth of the capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year; and the balance of the expenditure shall be deducted in equal instalments in each of the four immediately succeeding previous years. There is an explanation which is not relevant for our present purposes. Reading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v) as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(iv) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii) of sub-section (1) of section 32 for the same previous year in respect of that asset;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(v) where the asset mentioned in clause (ii) is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business, depreciation shall be admissible under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section(1) of section 32.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Reference must also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in this context. It read as follows at the relevant time:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Explanation: Where an asset is used in business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business and a deduction has to be made under clause (i), clause (ii) or clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii) of sub-section (I) or sub- section (1A) of section 32 in respect of that asset, the actual cost of the asset to the assessee, as reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed under clause (iv) of sub-section (1) of section 35 or under any corresponding provision of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>From the above it will be seen that the provisions of Section 32(1) (ii) and Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read with Explanation 1 to s.43(1) virtually repeat the provisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of the 1922 Act, so that the question earlier posed still loomed in the background of 1961 Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968 there was an amendment in the provisions of Section 35(2). The sub-section was amended to read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(2) For the purposes of clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iv) of sub-section (1),-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) in a case where such capital expenditure is incurred before the 1st day of April, 1967, one-fifth of the capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>and the balance of the expenditure shall be deducted in equal instalments for each of the four immediately succeeding previous years;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i-a) in a case where such capital expenditure is incurred after the 31st day of March, 1967, the whole of such capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The effect of this amendment was only to provided that the entire amount of capital expenditure incurred in relation to scientific research was allowed as a deduction in one year instead of being spread over a period of five years as was the position earlier. This amendment does not touch the controversy in issue before us and it has no solution to offer to our present difficulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provisions of Section 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the old Act had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the provisions of Section 32 and 35 of the 1961 Act have been administered since 1962. The question whether an assessee can simultaneously claim an allowance or deduction in respect of the same expenditure once under Section 32 and again in Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and does appear that such a double claim was put forward in some cases. The contention on behalf of the assessees was that the allowances in respect of depreciation on the one hand and in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research on the other are two totally different and independent heads of allowances. one is a notional allowance to provide for the wear and tear of a capital asset employed in the business as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for actual expenditure of a capital nature granted, on the eve of our country&#39;s independence, in order to give fillip to new industrial innovations and the development of indigenous know-how and techniques by proper planning on research and development by various business houses. It is therefore suggested that there is nothing absurd in construing the statutes act as providing cumulatively for both types of deductions in respect of the same capital asset. The only limitations on this right are the two placed by the statute itself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (iv) is that both the deductions cannot be claimed &quot;for the same previous year&quot; in respect of the same capital asset. The second limitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (v) which say that if a capital asset used for scientific research ceases to be so used but is thereafter brought into a business for use therein, the actual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect of the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its original cost reduced by the amount of deductions allowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or s.35(2). In other words, the contention of the assessee was and is that both the types of allowances are permissible under the statute except to the extent limited by clauses (d) and (e) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act and reproduced in clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before us it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that this interpretation of the statutory provisions is very clear, patent and unambiguous. It is alleged that despite this, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim of depreciation in respect of such capital assets even in previous years during which no deduction was claimed or allowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary to the clear language of clause (d) of s.10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either by the Appellate Commissioner or by the Tribunal. It was suggested that these decisions were almost unanimously in favour of the assessee but the department persisted in pursuing the matter upto the stage of the High Court. Only one reference on this topic came up before the High Courts and is reflected in the decision of the Karnataka High Court, reported as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd., (1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977 made at the instance of the Commissioner of Income Tax and the Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High (Sourt re-affirmed the position contended for by the assessee as the one and only possible interpretation of the statutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there was, and could have been, no doubt that an assessee was entitled to claim depreciation allowance in respect of such assets in respect of previous years other than those in which an allowance had been allowed under the other head. We shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened. It amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(iv) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section (1) of section 32 for the same or any other previous year in respect of that asset.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(Emphasis added) The Finance Act made this amendment retrospective w.e.f. 1.4.62, that is, the date of the commencement of the 1961 Act. This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its effect. It will result in completion of the pending assessments of several years on the footing of the new provision. It will also involve re-opening or rectification of completed assessments of earlier years, to the extent permissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in cases where assessees had been granted &quot;double allowance&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>accepting their contention at the time of the original assessments. The effect will be not for one assessment year but for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting a very grim picture of the consequences of giving full retrospective effect to the amendment, the assessees say that it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them over the years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open to action by creditor and financial institutions. Such an onerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable and oppressive and the provision imposing such burden violates the fundamental rights of the assessees under Articles 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution of India. It is on this plea that, even though assessments and appeals are pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose to approach this Court by way of writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution. These are mostly writ petitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing after a period of 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learned counsel for the assessees do not contest the competence of the legislature to enact the impugned provision, nor do they dispute the right of the legislature to give retrospective effect to statutory provisions. The contention only is that retrospective provisions may be permissible even in taxing statutes in certain special circumstances such as in the case of provisions clarifying the impact of a statute, provisions curing defective legislations in the light of the judicial decisions and the like. They, however, say that if the legislature chooses to impose a totally new burden, which was not at all in contemplation earlier and proceeds to give full retrospective effect thereto, such an attempt should be struck down as unreasonable and discriminatory. The principal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1) Were the earlier statutory provisions capable of only one interpretation, namely, that placed by the assessees or was there any ambiguity in relation thereto ? (2) If there was some doubt or ambiguity about the earlier legislation, and the 1980 Act clarified the position by a retrospective amendment, would it offend the provisions of the Constitution ?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(3) If, on the other hand, the earlier provision was very clear and capable of only one interpretation, as placed by the assessee, was the legislature within its rights in amending the provision retrospectively w.e.f. 1.4.62 and thus imposing an unreasonable tax burden on the assessees?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking up the first of the three questions, it has to be considered from two angles, one factual and the other, legal. An attempt was made on behalf of the petitioners to project an image as if the interpretation sought to be placed by the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow depreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never received the approval of the higher appellate authorities. It was suggested that the appeals by assessees against the disallowance invariably succeeded and it was the Department that had to move the High Court on reference, the first of which references came up before the Karnataka High Court in C.l.T. v. Indian Telephone Industries (1980) 126 I.T.R. 548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of such allegations the petitioners attempted to make out that the Department&#39;s interpretation was patently untenable and that the 1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory clarification of an ambiguity but a totally new and fresh imposition sought to be unjustifiably given retrospective effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of the averments of the petitioner in one of the cases, viz., W.P.1153/81, the impression sought to be created by the petitioners does not accord with the correct facts. The position in the case is available only as it stood at the time when the writ petition and the counter affidavit were filed and subsequent developments are not known. Nevertheless, the picture that emerges is this. In that case, the Income-tax Officer (I.T.O.) is said to have allowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research, for the assessment year 1969-70, though this is denied by the department. The claim was perhaps disallowed by the I.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed by the Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (I.T.A.T.) by its order dated 30.8.76. For the assessment year 1971-72, the I.T.O. disallowed the depreciation. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner (A.A.C.) allowed it. The department appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which accepted the department&#39;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79 placing reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the I.T.A.T. It has been stated that the assessee filed an application for reference to the High Court which was pending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment years 1972-73 to 1974-75, the assessments are pending as a stay order had been obtained for reasons which are not known. For the assessment years 1975-76 and 1976-77, the assessee claimed depreciation on a number of items of scientific research assets. The I.T.O. &quot;allowed&quot; the claims subject to the rider that &quot;there is no provision to give deduction of more than 100% of the expenditure by way of depreciation&quot;. The assessee appealed to Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78, the l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the assessee&#39;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81, the assessments are stated to be pending. The above facts are sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there is no information before us as to the position between 1.4.1946 and 31.3.1968 - the Department has been putting forward its objections on the issue and that the same was the subject matter of controversy at various appellate stages, some decided in favour of, and some against, the assessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided the issue against the assessee. In this background, it is not correct to say that the position was crystal clear and that, save for a few ITOs who took a biassed view, the authorities were all agreed that the Department&#39;s stand was untenable. Some of the reported decisions also show that there was a live controversy and that references have been made to the High Court both at the instances or the assessees [see Alkali &amp; Chemical Corporation of India Ltd. v. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian Explosives Ltd., (1992) 192 I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as at the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International Instruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v. Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.) and Warner Hindustan Ltd. v. CIT, (1988) 171 I.T.R. 224 (A.P.)]. The petitioner&#39;s contention that, under the pre-amended provisions, depreciation on such assets was recognised allround as clearly allowable is therefore rejected. We have dealt with this aspect only to meet an aspect that was urged. What is really important is the true and correct interpretation of those provisions, not what someone thought of it then and to this aspect we shall now turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second aspect of the First of the three questions posed earlier for our consideration is the legal or interpretational aspect of the provisions as they stood prior to the 1980 Amendment. Under the provisions of the statute as they stood earlier, could the assessees have claimed continued grant of depreciation after the expiry of five previous years before the 1968 amendment and after the expiry or the first year after the 1968 amendment, even though the entire cost of the capital asset in question had been allowed to be written off completely against the business profits of those five previous years or one previous year as the case may be? We think the answer to this question must emphatically be in the negative. In our view, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having envisaged a double deduction in respect of the same expenditure, even though it is true that the two heads of deduction do not completely overlap and there is some difference in the rationale of the two deductions under consideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed on the following circumstances to support a contention that the statute did not intend one deduction to preclude the other :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) lt is pointed out that s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act, was inserted in 1946 consequent on the insertion of a corresponding provision in the United Kingdom. That provision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944 read thus :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(4) Where a deduction is allowed for any year under this or the last preceding section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by any assets, no deduction shall be allowed under any provisions of the Income-tax Act other than this part of this Act in respect of wear and tear, obsolescence, depreciation or exceptional depreciation of these assets for any year of assessment during any part of which they are used by the person carrying on the trade for scientific research related to the trade. &quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(emphasis supplied) The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate departure from the said provision and limited the bar of depreciation only to those previous years during which a deduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) When the Income-tax Bill, 1961 was under the consideration of the Law Commission, the provisions of S.10(2) (vi) and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes were made and the provisions of the new Act in this regard were drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) and S.35(2) (iv) again is significantly different from the language used in various other provisions of the Act which, in like contexts of possible double allowances, emphatically rule out deductions in respect of the same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income under two different provisions for the same or even any other assessment year : See, for example, Sections 20(2) 35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8), 80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation shall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a disallowance only in those previous years and means,</p>\r\n', '<p>ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition No. 90 of 1981 etc. etc, (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).

Subhashini for the Respondents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN, J. The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as &#39;the 1980 Act&#39;) to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as &#39;the 1961 Act&#39;). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question is really one of interpretation of two important provisions relating to the computation of business income for purposes of income tax. We may start with the provisions of the Indian lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as the &#39;1922 Act&#39;). The computation of business income for purposes of income tax was done in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the said Act. In the process of making such computation, the Act provided for two important deductions (among others), in respect of the capital assets employed in the business. The first was the deduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance in respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant or furniture being the property of the assessee and used for the purposes of the business, at a prescribed percentage of the written down value of such assets. This allowance is calculated, in respect of the year of acquisition of the property, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee and in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of the actual cost less the depreciation allowances granted in the preceding years. In strict principle, this is an allowance of capital nature but it is now well settled that the allowance of depreciation has to be taken into account in order to ascertain the true profits of a business and, therefore, an assessee is permitted to deduct, in the computation of the business income year after year, the prescribed percentage of the value of the assets used for the purposes of business. The second allowance was not there in the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income- tax (Amendment) Act, 1946. The introduction was of certain allowances in respect of expenditure on. &quot;scientific research related to the business&quot;, an expression which was defined in a fairly comprehensive manner by the statute. Three types of allowances were permitted in respect of this category of expenditure of which we are here concerned with only one. This provision was contained in clause (xiv) of S.10(2) which permitted a deduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business, an allowance for each of the Five consecutive previous year. beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred, or where the expenditure was incurred prior to the commencement of the business, for each of the five consecutive previous years beginning with the year in which the business was commenced, equal 2to one-fifth of such expenditure: Provided that no allowance shall be made for any expenditure incurred more than three years before the commencement of the business: A Provided further that-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>XXX XXX XXX</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(d) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this clause in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by any asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clause (vi) or clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(vii) for the same previous year in respect of that asset;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(e) where an asset is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business, and a claim for an allowance under clause (vi) or clause (vii) is made in respect of that asset, the actual cost to the assessee of the asset shall be treated as reduced by the amount of any deductions allowed under this clause;&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A cursory and conjoint reading of section 10(2) (vi) and section 10(2) (xiv) suggests that where an assessee incurs expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business and the expenditure results in the acquisition of an asset, the assessee can claim, under clause (vi), a deduction of the specified percentage of the written down value of the asset and under clause</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years, of the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the asset. For this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used for scientific research related to the business is also ipso facto an asset used for the purpose of business. There has been some debate before us as to whether this is always so but we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes of the present case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will at once be seen that, if these two provisions are applied simultaneously, it would result in granting an assessee a double allowance in respect of the same expenditure - one of the entire amount over a period of 5 years and the other a percentage of the expenditure over a number . consecutive years at a graded scale as already mentioned. The question at once leaps to the mind as to whether it could have been the intention of the legislature to permit both these deductions simultaneously to an assessee. The provisions of clauses (d) and (e) of the proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) contain a clue to answer this question. More about it later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We next turn to the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic of depreciation is dealt with by section 32. Section 32(1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is allowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain capital assets employed in the bussiness. The topic of scientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35. Section 35(1) provides for the deduction of four types of expenditure on scientific research and what we are concerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv), which is to the following effect:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iv) in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee, such deduction as may be admissible under the provisions of sub- section (2).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Sub-section (2) provides that, for the purposes of clause (iv)of sub-section (1), one-fifth of the capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year; and the balance of the expenditure shall be deducted in equal instalments in each of the four immediately succeeding previous years. There is an explanation which is not relevant for our present purposes. Reading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v) as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(iv) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii) of sub-section (1) of section 32 for the same previous year in respect of that asset;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(v) where the asset mentioned in clause (ii) is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business, depreciation shall be admissible under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section(1) of section 32.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Reference must also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in this context. It read as follows at the relevant time:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Explanation: Where an asset is used in business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business and a deduction has to be made under clause (i), clause (ii) or clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii) of sub-section (I) or sub- section (1A) of section 32 in respect of that asset, the actual cost of the asset to the assessee, as reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed under clause (iv) of sub-section (1) of section 35 or under any corresponding provision of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>From the above it will be seen that the provisions of Section 32(1) (ii) and Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read with Explanation 1 to s.43(1) virtually repeat the provisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of the 1922 Act, so that the question earlier posed still loomed in the background of 1961 Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968 there was an amendment in the provisions of Section 35(2). The sub-section was amended to read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(2) For the purposes of clause</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iv) of sub-section (1),-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) in a case where such capital expenditure is incurred before the 1st day of April, 1967, one-fifth of the capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>and the balance of the expenditure shall be deducted in equal instalments for each of the four immediately succeeding previous years;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i-a) in a case where such capital expenditure is incurred after the 31st day of March, 1967, the whole of such capital expenditure incurred in any previous year shall be deducted for that previous year.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The effect of this amendment was only to provided that the entire amount of capital expenditure incurred in relation to scientific research was allowed as a deduction in one year instead of being spread over a period of five years as was the position earlier. This amendment does not touch the controversy in issue before us and it has no solution to offer to our present difficulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provisions of Section 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the old Act had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the provisions of Section 32 and 35 of the 1961 Act have been administered since 1962. The question whether an assessee can simultaneously claim an allowance or deduction in respect of the same expenditure once under Section 32 and again in Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and does appear that such a double claim was put forward in some cases. The contention on behalf of the assessees was that the allowances in respect of depreciation on the one hand and in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research on the other are two totally different and independent heads of allowances. one is a notional allowance to provide for the wear and tear of a capital asset employed in the business as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for actual expenditure of a capital nature granted, on the eve of our country&#39;s independence, in order to give fillip to new industrial innovations and the development of indigenous know-how and techniques by proper planning on research and development by various business houses. It is therefore suggested that there is nothing absurd in construing the statutes act as providing cumulatively for both types of deductions in respect of the same capital asset. The only limitations on this right are the two placed by the statute itself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (iv) is that both the deductions cannot be claimed &quot;for the same previous year&quot; in respect of the same capital asset. The second limitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (v) which say that if a capital asset used for scientific research ceases to be so used but is thereafter brought into a business for use therein, the actual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect of the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its original cost reduced by the amount of deductions allowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or s.35(2). In other words, the contention of the assessee was and is that both the types of allowances are permissible under the statute except to the extent limited by clauses (d) and (e) of the proviso to Section 10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act and reproduced in clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before us it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that this interpretation of the statutory provisions is very clear, patent and unambiguous. It is alleged that despite this, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim of depreciation in respect of such capital assets even in previous years during which no deduction was claimed or allowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary to the clear language of clause (d) of s.10(2) (xiv) and s.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either by the Appellate Commissioner or by the Tribunal. It was suggested that these decisions were almost unanimously in favour of the assessee but the department persisted in pursuing the matter upto the stage of the High Court. Only one reference on this topic came up before the High Courts and is reflected in the decision of the Karnataka High Court, reported as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd., (1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977 made at the instance of the Commissioner of Income Tax and the Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High (Sourt re-affirmed the position contended for by the assessee as the one and only possible interpretation of the statutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there was, and could have been, no doubt that an assessee was entitled to claim depreciation allowance in respect of such assets in respect of previous years other than those in which an allowance had been allowed under the other head. We shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened. It amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(iv) where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset, no deduction shall be allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section (1) of section 32 for the same or any other previous year in respect of that asset.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(Emphasis added) The Finance Act made this amendment retrospective w.e.f. 1.4.62, that is, the date of the commencement of the 1961 Act. This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its effect. It will result in completion of the pending assessments of several years on the footing of the new provision. It will also involve re-opening or rectification of completed assessments of earlier years, to the extent permissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in cases where assessees had been granted &quot;double allowance&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>accepting their contention at the time of the original assessments. The effect will be not for one assessment year but for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting a very grim picture of the consequences of giving full retrospective effect to the amendment, the assessees say that it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them over the years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open to action by creditor and financial institutions. Such an onerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable and oppressive and the provision imposing such burden violates the fundamental rights of the assessees under Articles 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution of India. It is on this plea that, even though assessments and appeals are pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose to approach this Court by way of writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution. These are mostly writ petitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing after a period of 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learned counsel for the assessees do not contest the competence of the legislature to enact the impugned provision, nor do they dispute the right of the legislature to give retrospective effect to statutory provisions. The contention only is that retrospective provisions may be permissible even in taxing statutes in certain special circumstances such as in the case of provisions clarifying the impact of a statute, provisions curing defective legislations in the light of the judicial decisions and the like. They, however, say that if the legislature chooses to impose a totally new burden, which was not at all in contemplation earlier and proceeds to give full retrospective effect thereto, such an attempt should be struck down as unreasonable and discriminatory. The principal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1) Were the earlier statutory provisions capable of only one interpretation, namely, that placed by the assessees or was there any ambiguity in relation thereto ? (2) If there was some doubt or ambiguity about the earlier legislation, and the 1980 Act clarified the position by a retrospective amendment, would it offend the provisions of the Constitution ?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(3) If, on the other hand, the earlier provision was very clear and capable of only one interpretation, as placed by the assessee, was the legislature within its rights in amending the provision retrospectively w.e.f. 1.4.62 and thus imposing an unreasonable tax burden on the assessees?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking up the first of the three questions, it has to be considered from two angles, one factual and the other, legal. An attempt was made on behalf of the petitioners to project an image as if the interpretation sought to be placed by the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow depreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never received the approval of the higher appellate authorities. It was suggested that the appeals by assessees against the disallowance invariably succeeded and it was the Department that had to move the High Court on reference, the first of which references came up before the Karnataka High Court in C.l.T. v. Indian Telephone Industries (1980) 126 I.T.R. 548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of such allegations the petitioners attempted to make out that the Department&#39;s interpretation was patently untenable and that the 1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory clarification of an ambiguity but a totally new and fresh imposition sought to be unjustifiably given retrospective effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of the averments of the petitioner in one of the cases, viz., W.P.1153/81, the impression sought to be created by the petitioners does not accord with the correct facts. The position in the case is available only as it stood at the time when the writ petition and the counter affidavit were filed and subsequent developments are not known. Nevertheless, the picture that emerges is this. In that case, the Income-tax Officer (I.T.O.) is said to have allowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research, for the assessment year 1969-70, though this is denied by the department. The claim was perhaps disallowed by the I.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed by the Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (I.T.A.T.) by its order dated 30.8.76. For the assessment year 1971-72, the I.T.O. disallowed the depreciation. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner (A.A.C.) allowed it. The department appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which accepted the department&#39;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79 placing reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the I.T.A.T. It has been stated that the assessee filed an application for reference to the High Court which was pending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment years 1972-73 to 1974-75, the assessments are pending as a stay order had been obtained for reasons which are not known. For the assessment years 1975-76 and 1976-77, the assessee claimed depreciation on a number of items of scientific research assets. The I.T.O. &quot;allowed&quot; the claims subject to the rider that &quot;there is no provision to give deduction of more than 100% of the expenditure by way of depreciation&quot;. The assessee appealed to Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78, the l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the assessee&#39;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81, the assessments are stated to be pending. The above facts are sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there is no information before us as to the position between 1.4.1946 and 31.3.1968 - the Department has been putting forward its objections on the issue and that the same was the subject matter of controversy at various appellate stages, some decided in favour of, and some against, the assessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided the issue against the assessee. In this background, it is not correct to say that the position was crystal clear and that, save for a few ITOs who took a biassed view, the authorities were all agreed that the Department&#39;s stand was untenable. Some of the reported decisions also show that there was a live controversy and that references have been made to the High Court both at the instances or the assessees [see Alkali &amp; Chemical Corporation of India Ltd. v. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian Explosives Ltd., (1992) 192 I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as at the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International Instruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v. Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.) and Warner Hindustan Ltd. v. CIT, (1988) 171 I.T.R. 224 (A.P.)]. The petitioner&#39;s contention that, under the pre-amended provisions, depreciation on such assets was recognised allround as clearly allowable is therefore rejected. We have dealt with this aspect only to meet an aspect that was urged. What is really important is the true and correct interpretation of those provisions, not what someone thought of it then and to this aspect we shall now turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second aspect of the First of the three questions posed earlier for our consideration is the legal or interpretational aspect of the provisions as they stood prior to the 1980 Amendment. Under the provisions of the statute as they stood earlier, could the assessees have claimed continued grant of depreciation after the expiry of five previous years before the 1968 amendment and after the expiry or the first year after the 1968 amendment, even though the entire cost of the capital asset in question had been allowed to be written off completely against the business profits of those five previous years or one previous year as the case may be? We think the answer to this question must emphatically be in the negative. In our view, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having envisaged a double deduction in respect of the same expenditure, even though it is true that the two heads of deduction do not completely overlap and there is some difference in the rationale of the two deductions under consideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed on the following circumstances to support a contention that the statute did not intend one deduction to preclude the other :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) lt is pointed out that s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922 Act, was inserted in 1946 consequent on the insertion of a corresponding provision in the United Kingdom. That provision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944 read thus :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(4) Where a deduction is allowed for any year under this or the last preceding section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by any assets, no deduction shall be allowed under any provisions of the Income-tax Act other than this part of this Act in respect of wear and tear, obsolescence, depreciation or exceptional depreciation of these assets for any year of assessment during any part of which they are used by the person carrying on the trade for scientific research related to the trade. &quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(emphasis supplied) The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate departure from the said provision and limited the bar of depreciation only to those previous years during which a deduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) When the Income-tax Bill, 1961 was under the consideration of the Law Commission, the provisions of S.10(2) (vi) and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes were made and the provisions of the new Act in this regard were drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to S.10(2) (xiv) and S.35(2) (iv) again is significantly different from the language used in various other provisions of the Act which, in like contexts of possible double allowances, emphatically rule out deductions in respect of the same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income under two different provisions for the same or even any other assessment year : See, for example, Sections 20(2) 35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8), 80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation shall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a disallowance only in those previous years and means,</p>\r\n', NULL, '1000149', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 'Constitutional  Law', 1, NULL, 'Noise Pollution', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, '1', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-02');

The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under&nbsp;Section 76&nbsp;of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in&nbsp;All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath&nbsp;: , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser of the interest of the mortgager filed a suit for possession of the property from the head lessee and the sub-lessees. The sub-lessees claimed the benefit of East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 (3 of 1949). In the High Court three points were raised. One of the points urged was whether the defendants were protected by the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act. This Court first considered the question : Did the tenancy created by the mortgagee in possession survive the termination of the mortgagee interest so as to be binding on the purchaser? This Court concluded :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship of lessor and lessee cannot subsist beyond the mortgagee&#39;s interest unless the relationship is agreed to by the mortgagor or a fresh relationship is recreated. This the mortgagor or the person succeeding to the mortgagor&#39;s interest may elect to do. But if he does not, the lessee cannot claim any rights beyond the term of his original lessor&#39;s interest. These propositions are well-understood and find support in two rulings of this Court in&nbsp;Mahabir Gope and Ors. v. Harbansnarain Singh(2) and&nbsp;Asaramand Ors. v. Mst. Ram Kali (1958) SCR 986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Referring to&nbsp;Section 76(a)&nbsp;of the Transfer of Property Act, this Court observed :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this (provision) it is inferred that acts done bona fide and prudently in the ordinary course of management, may bind even after the termination of the title of the mortgagee in possession. This principle applies ordinarily to the management of agricultural land and has seldom been extended to urban property so as to the it up in the hands of lessees or to confer on them rights under special statutes....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the facts of the case this Court held :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case is thus not covered by the exception because we cannot held that such a long lease on such a small rent was an act of prudence, whether it was a bonafide act or not, and whether the exception can apply to urban property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. In the present appeal there is a finding of the District Judge that the lease was not an act of prudent management. Further, the rent deed itself stipulated that the lessee would vacate the house and hand over the same to respondent No. 4 in case owner of the House got the house released from mortgage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. This Court then examined the question whether the tenants could take advantage of the Provisions of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949. The Court answered the question in the following words :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The respondents attempted to argue that the Rent Restriction Act defines landlord and tenant with reference to the payment of rent. A landlord means a person entitled to receive rent and a tenant means any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable. These definitions apply if the tenancy, either real or statutory, could be said to survive after the termination of the mortgage.... The termination of the mortgagee interest terminated the relationship of landlord and tenant and it could not, in the circumstances be said to run with the land. There being no landlord and no tenant, the provisions of the Rent Restriction Act could not apply any further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. The definitions of the words &quot;tenant&quot; and &quot;landlord in the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act are similar. We may mention that the same view was taken by the Bombay High Court in Kamalakar &amp; Co. v. Gulatnsha.fi Jmambhai Mussalman ILR (1963) Bom. 236 and&nbsp;Bhanshali Khushalchand Shamji v. Shah Shamji Jivraj&nbsp;(1957) 59 BLR 684.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.</p>\r\n', '<p>JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.

Rana and Ravindra Bana, for the respondents. (in C. A. No. 2008/71).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Judgment of the, Court was delivered by Hegde, J. These are appeals by certificate. They raise common questions of law for decision, and they are directed against a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court. The facts of the case lie within a narrow compass. The appellants are dealers in foodgrains including cereals and pulses especially split or processed foodgrains and dal. The dispute in this case centers round the question whether the Government is competent to levy sales-tax on the purchases made by the appellants of split processed foodgrains and dal under the provisions of the United Provinces Sales Tax Act, 1948 as amended by the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1970 (which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act). Under the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood which will</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-hereinafter be referred to as the principal Act), the purchases of split or processed foodgrains and dal by dealers were sought, to be brought to tax under s. 3-D of the principal Act read with the notification issued. The validity of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand Prasan Kumar, the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&#39;. 1625 of 1971 in respect of the assessment made on him for the assessment year 1966-67 by assessment order dated June 30, 1968 by means of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The High Court of Allahabad struck down the levy holding that the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not be said to be a commodity essentially different from the arhar dal purchased by the dal mills and accordingly the purchases effected by the petitioner could not be regarded as the first purchases. This decision is reported in 25, S.T.C. p. 118. Thereafter the Governor of U.P. issued an ordinance known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance No. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as well as s. 7 to the principal Act. This ordinance was later on enacted as an Act to which we have already made reference. The provisions of the Amending Act are identical with the provisions in the Ordinance. Though at the time of the institution of the writ petitions from which these appeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into the Act, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of the writ petitions. Hence we shall refer to the provisions of the Amending Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in s. 2(c) as &quot; &quot;dealer&quot; means any person or association of persons carrying on the business of buying or selling goods in Uttar Pradesh, whether for commission, remuneration or otherwise, and includes any firm or Hindu Joint Family and any society, club or association which sells goods to its members and also includes any department of the State Government or the Central Government which carries on such business and any undertaking engaged in the generation or distribution of electrical energy or any other form of power.&quot; (Explanation to the section is not relevant for our present purpose).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy of multi-point tax. The portion of that section which is material for our present purpose reads :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Subject to the provisions of this Act, every dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on his turnover of such year, which shall be determined in such manner as may be prescribed&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 3-A provides for a single point taxation in respect of sale of certain goods. At present we are only concerned with s. 3- D(1). It provides :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Except as provided in sub-section (2), there shall be levied and paid, for each assessment year or part thereof, a tax on the turnover, to be determined in such manner as may be prescribed, of first purchases made by a dealer or through a dealer, acting as a purchasing agent in respect of such goods or class of goods, and at such rates, not exceeding two paise per rupee in the case of foodgrains, including cereals and pulses, and five paise per rupee in the case of other goods and with effect from such date, as may, from time to time, be notified by the, State Government in this behalf.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant for our purpose).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on October 1, 1964 (Notification No. S. T. 7122/X) provided that with effect from October 1, 1964, the turnover of purchases in respect of goods mentioned therein shall be liable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned: &quot;Foodgrains 1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase On the basis of s. 3-D read with the notification, as mentioned earlier, the authorities under the Act sought to bring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases of processed or split foodgrains including dal on the ground that they constituted a separate item of foodgrains quite independent of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains. This view, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court. After the decision of the High Court, the principal Act was amended. Under the. Amending Act one more Explanation viz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;For the purposes of this sub-section, split or processed foodgrains, such as in the form of dal shall be deemed to be different from unsplit or unprocessed foodgrains, and accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall be construed to prevent the imposition, levy or collection of the tax in respect of the first purchases of split or processed foodgrains merely because. tax had been im- posed levied or collected earlier in respect of the first purchases of those foodgrains in their unsplit or unprocessed form.&quot; The Amending Act also added a validating provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That section reads :</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, every notification issued or purporting to have been issued under Section 3-A or Section 3-D of the principal Act before the com- mencement of this Act shall be deemed to have been issued under that section as amended by this Act and shall be so interpreted and be deemed to be and always to have been as valid as if the provisions of this Act were in force at all material times; and accordingly anything done or any action taken (including any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction exercised, assessment made, or tax levied, collected or paid purporting to have been done or taken in pursuance of any such notification) shall be deemed to be, and always to have been, validly and lawfully done or taken.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It will be necessary later on to consider what was the vice that the legislature intended to cure by the Amending Act. The</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>--L498Sup Cl/73 sequence of events itself discloses the purpose of the Ordinance as well as the Amending Act. That apart, the statement of objects and reasons which can be usefully looked into for the purpose of finding the vice that the legislature was trying to provide against reads thus &quot;Sections 3-A and 3-D of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 provide for single point taxation. Under the fondler section the tax is levied on the turnover of sales, while under the latter the tax is levied on the turnover of first purchases. Plain and ornamented glass bangles are subject to tax separately under section 3- A. Similarly, unsplit and split pulses are separately subject to tax under section 3-D. It has been held by the High Court in one case that tax cannot be levied separately on plain and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A and in another that tax cannot be levied separately on unsplit and split pulses under section 3-D because in their opinion plain glass bangles are not a commodity different from ornamented glass bangles and similarly unsplit pulses and split pulses are also not two different commodities. These judgments have created legal difficulties in the assessment and collection of tax on the aforesaid commodities. Besides, the dealers have started applying for the refund of tax already collected on these commodities. Ibis will have serious repercussions on the State&#39;s revenue. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend sections 3-A and 3-D to provide for the levy of tax on the aforesaid commodities as separate items. It is also proposed to validate the past levy, assessment and collection of tax on the above commodities.&quot; (The remaining part of the statement of objects and reasons is not relevant for our present purpose).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The appellants challenged the validity of Explanation 11 of S. 3-D as well as s. 7 introduced by the Amending Act before the High Court of Allahabad in petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution. They further took the plea that the amendments incorporated were not effective enough to bring to tax the first purchases of split or processed foodgrains and pulses. The High Court rejected these contentions and dismissed the writ petitions. Thereafter these appeals have been brought after obtaining certificates from the High Court.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The validity of the levy in question was challenged on the following grounds&#39;: (1) That no fresh levy can be imposed by a retrospective legislation;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(2) That the legislature cannot in case of legislation of the nature with which we are concerned, separate into independent commodities split and unsplit pulses or processed or unprocessed pulses and on that footing seek to impose tax twice over on the same commodity in respect of the goods liable to be taxed at a single point;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(3) That the newly added Explanation to s. 3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by the legislature;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(4) The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution There is no rational basis for separating split or processed pulses from unsplit or unprocessed pulses;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(5) On a true construction of Explanation It to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to have been imposed, (6) No levy of purchase tax can be made without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read with Explanation 11 showing therein separately foodgrains unsplit or unprocessed as well as foodgrains split or processed; and (7) That the power conferred on the Government under s. 3-D amounts to an excessive delegation of legislative power. and consequently void.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The source of the legislative power to levy sales or purchase tax on goods is Entry 54 of the List II of the Constitution. It is well settled that subject to constitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes a power to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively. In this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes within itself the power to tax retrospectively--see The Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P. Sundararamier &amp; Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ; J. K. Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.; (3) Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. v. The Union of India and Anr. (4 Sri Ramkrishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Bihar. (5) In the last mentioned case it was specifically decided that where the legislature can make a valid law, it can provide not only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of the said law but it can also provide for the retrospective operation of the said provisions. We see no force in the second contention advanced on behalf of the appellants. As seen earlier the general rule as enunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or purchase tax; but power (1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) [1958] S. C. R. 1422.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) 12. S.T.C. 429.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) [1962] Supp, (2) S.C.R. p. 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(5) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 897.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is conferred on the Government to select any transaction in respect of such goods or class of goods as the Government may choose to levy a single point sales tax or purchase tax. It is open to the legislature to define the nature of the goods, the sale or purchase of which should be brought to tax. Legislature was not incompetent to separate the processed or split pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed pulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods. In Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question arose for decision whether it was open to the legislature to impose separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well as on broken leaf of tobacco. This Court overruled the contention that such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open for the legislature to separate the two items. We see no basis for the contention that the legislature cannot for the purpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed Pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed. The power of the legislature to specify the nature of the goods the sale or purchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide. Now coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the contention that the legislature has usurped any judicial power. The legislature has not purported either directly or by necessary implication to overrule the decisions of the Allahabad High. Court in Tilok Chand Prasan Kumar&#39;s case (supra). On the other hand it. has accepted tha</p>\r\n', '<p>CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeals Nos. 821 and 822 of 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appeals by certificates from the judgment and orders dated July 14, and August 22, 1970 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc.

It is open to the legislature to define the nature of the goods, the sale or purchase of which should be brought to tax. Legislature was not incompetent to separate the processed or split pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed pulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods. In Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question arose for decision whether it was open to the legislature to impose separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well as on broken leaf of tobacco. This Court overruled the contention that such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open for the legislature to separate the two items. We see no basis for the contention that the legislature cannot for the purpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed Pulses from the unsplit or unprocessed. The power of the legislature to specify the nature of the goods the sale or purchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide. Now coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the contention that the legislature has usurped any judicial power. The legislature has not purported either directly or by necessary implication to overrule the decisions of the Allahabad High. Court in Tilok Chand Prasan Kumar&#39;s case (supra).

The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment.

Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs.', NULL, '<p id=\"p_1\">CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal  No.  2025  of\n1968.\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">Appeal	 from  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  the	18th\nOctober,1967  of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in C.

The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">    This  stipulation  does n', '<p id=\"p_1\">With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.)

It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_9\">    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">    This  stipulation  does n', NULL, '100040791', NULL, NULL, 1, NULL, 'NA', 1, NULL, 'NA', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-03');

Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State</p>\r\n', '<p>The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Civil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State</p>\r\n', NULL, '1000425', '1', NULL, 1, NULL, 'NA', 1, NULL, 'NA', '', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-03'),

Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute. [1060 C-G] Authority of Customs, Madras, v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty and Anr., [1962] 3 SCR 786; New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad</p>\r\n', NULL, '<p>63 at 69; Council v. Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Enquiry No. 91 of 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ashok H. Desai, B.H. Wani, Ravinder Narain, Talat Ansari, A.N. Haksar and Shri Narain for the Appellant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soli J. Sorabjee, Addl. Sol. Genl., R.B. Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>buting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Distributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch. Price lists will be furnished to Distributor by the Company, but the Company reserves the right to change prices at any time without notice.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (11): PRICE CHANGES :-If the Company reduces its published suggested retail list price, for any current model of &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles, the company will make an allowance to Distributor as hereinafter provided. The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * *</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>ing or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>less a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>and contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>just as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Lord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>two Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>x x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the</p>\r\n', '<p>63 at 69; Council v. Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>buting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Distributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Section (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch. Price lists will be furnished to Distributor by the Company, but the Company reserves the right to change prices at any time without notice.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (11): PRICE CHANGES :-If the Company reduces its published suggested retail list price, for any current model of &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles, the company will make an allowance to Distributor as hereinafter provided. The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* * * *</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>ing or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>less a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>and contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>just as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Lord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>two Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>x x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle.

The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.

The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources.

In   compliance   of   the   said   order,   the   possession   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n460.15   Bighas   of   land   was   restored   to   them   on   27.05.1969 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the same was also mutated in their name.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_7\">(d)    On   some   complaints   being   made,   the   restoration   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland   was   cancelled   by   the   State   Government   on   01.05.1973. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_8\">Challenging   the   same,   the   respondents   filed   writ   petition \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  the  High  Court.     The  learned  single  Judge  of the  High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   by   order   dated   24.11.1976,     quashed   the   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.05.1973   and   directed   that   in   case   the   State   wants   to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreopen   the   order   dated   23.04.1969,   it   can   do   so   by   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproper opportunity of hearing to the petitioners therein.

It   was   also   stated   that   the   respondents   are \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliable   to   be   evicted   from   the   land   in   question.     The \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents filed objections against the notice for recalling the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder dated 23.04.1969.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_9\">(e)    Since the notice for recalling the order dated 23.04.1969 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas not been formally dropped, the respondents filed a suit in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Court   of   Munsif   and   Judicial   Magistrate,   Jodhpur   City, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJodhpur.

The parties \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared   before   the   Revenue   Minister.     By   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992,   the   Revenue   Minister   cancelled   the   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_10\">(f)    Challenging   the   order   of   the   Revenue   Minister,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   filed   a   petition   being   W.P.

Civil \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Appeal (W) No. 270 of 2002 and the respondents also \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   cross   objections   before   the   High   Court.     The   Division \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBench   of   the   High   Court,   by   impugned   judgment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.10.2003,   dismissed   the   appeal   filed   by   the   State   and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed the cross objection filed by the respondents herein.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_12\">(h)    Aggrieved   by   the   said   order   of   the   Division   Bench,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Government filed these appeals before this Court by way \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof special leave petitions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_13\">(3)    Heard   Dr.   Manish   Singhvi,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellants,   Mr.   Dipankar   Gupta,   learned   senior   counsel   for \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondent   Nos.   1-6   and   Ms.   Bhati,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintervenor.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_14\">(4)    The   main   issue   in   these   appeals   is   about   the   grant   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n460.15   bighas   of   land   on   23.04.1969   by   the  PHED  to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   herein.     As   far   as   the   remaining   land   of   143 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas   is   concerned,   even   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   in   the   impugned   order,   remitted   the   matter   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue Minister.  Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_15\">(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_16\">(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_17\">(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"p_18\">(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.

Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote>    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote>    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.</blockquote><p id=\"p_31\">\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">Explanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_33\">11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n</p><p id=\"p_34\">11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n</p>\n<blockquote>     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_35\">5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t', '<p id=\"p_1\">P.

The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_8\">(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_9\">(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n \n</p><p id=\"p_11\">(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">b)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_14\">(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_17\">(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period.

Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_28\">8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_30\">10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote>    \"6.

In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n</p>\n<blockquote>     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date.

The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_35\">5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette.

The trial court passed a preliminary decree giving various directions, however with regard to the above mentioned item which relates to 3 acre 40 cents, it was held that exhibit A1 document did not preclude the executants rights for disposing the same during their lifetime. Consequently, the trial court held that so far as item No.1 in schedule No. 8 of exhibit A1 is concerned, the same has the characteristics of a testamentary disposition, therefore not available for partition.

No. 62 of 1991 before the court of District Judge, Pathanamthitta, which was allowed vide judgment dated 26.03.1994 and the decree and judgment of the trial court was modified and a preliminary decree was passed allowing partition and possession of 3/6th share of various items including sub-item 1 of schedule No. 8 of exhibit A1 document. The Appellate Court took the view that the above item was settled by exhibit A1 in favour of the original plaintiffs and defendant Nos. 1 to 3 jointly though its possession and enjoyment were deferred till the death of the executants. It was also held that the assignment deed, executed by one of the executants and later by 3rd defendant, was not binding on the plaintiffs. Held: Subsequent events: Subsequent events or conduct of parties after the execution of the document shall not be taken into consideration in interpreting a document especially when there is no ambiguity in the language of the document. But we may refer to those events also only to re-enforce the fact that there is no ambiguity in the language employed in the document. Subsequent conduct of Eapen and Sosamma has no bearing in understanding the scope of exhibit A1 document. The executants, it may be noted, had jointly executed a mortgage on 12.11.1955 (exhibit B2) to one Mathew in which they had affirmed their right to execute such a mortgage and traced it to exhibit A1 document. Further, the executants had not parted with possession of item No.1 of 8th Schedule of exhibit A1 to their sons, at any point of time and retained ownership. Exhibit B3 document was executed in favour of 3rd defendant on 18.07.1964 and later he sold the property to 4th defendant on 23.01.1978 (exhibit B1). Now from 1978 onwards, the 4th defendant, a stranger to the family, has been in exclusive possession and ownership of the property. We may also point out even though Ext.B3 was executed on 18.07.1964, the suit was filed only on 6.2.1978, that is, after more than thirteen years. It will also be unjust to deprive him of his ownership and possession at this distance of time. Court, therefore, find that the right, title, interest, possession and ownership of item No.1 of 8th Schedule of Ex.A1 were with the executants and they had the full control and freedom to deal with that property as they liked unlike Schedule Nos. 1 to 6. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that so far as that item is concerned, the document in question cannot be construed as a settlement or a gift because there is no provision in the document transferring any interest in immovable property in praesenti in favour of settlees i.e. their sons. The judgment and decree of the lower appellate court, confirmed by the High Court, is, therefore, set aside and the judgment and decree of the trial court is restored. The appeal is allowed as above and there will be no order as to costs.</p>\r\n', NULL, '<p>K. S. Radhakrishnan, J.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Leave granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. We are, in this appeal, called upon to determine the question whether the recitals in exhibit A1 concerning item No.1 of schedule No. 8 therein (item No. 1 of the plaint schedule) discloses a testamentary disposition or a settlement creating vested rights in favour of the plaintiffs and defendant Nos. 1 to 3 though possession and enjoyment stood deferred until the death of the executants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. O.S. No. 169 of 1990 was instituted before the court of Subordinate Judge, Thiruvalla by the original plaintiffs and one Eapen for partition and separate possession of various items of properties, of which, we are in this appeal concerned only with item No. 1 of the plaint schedule. The trial court passed a preliminary decree giving various directions, however with regard to the above mentioned item which relates to 3 acre 40 cents, it was held that exhibit A1 document did not preclude the executants rights for disposing the same during their lifetime. Consequently, the trial court held that so far as item No.1 in schedule No. 8 of exhibit A1 is concerned, the same has the characteristics of a testamentary disposition, therefore not available for partition. The court held that B3 sale deed executed in favour of 3rd defendant in the year 1964 by Sosamma Eapen was valid so also B1 sale deed executed in the year 1978 by the 3rd defendant in favour of 4th defendant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The plaintiffs took up the matter in appeal as A.S. No. 62 of 1991 before the court of District Judge, Pathanamthitta, which was allowed vide judgment dated 26.03.1994 and the decree and judgment of the trial court was modified and a preliminary decree was passed allowing partition and possession of 3/6th share of various items including sub-item 1 of schedule No. 8 of exhibit A1 document. The Appellate Court took the view that the above item was settled by exhibit A1 in favour of the original plaintiffs and defendant Nos. 1 to 3 jointly though its possession and enjoyment were deferred till the death of the executants. It was also held that the assignment deed, executed by one of the executants and later by 3rd defendant, was not binding on the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 then filed Second Appeal No. 686/1994 before the High Court. The High Court affirmed the judgment of the lower appellate court vide judgment dated 12.03.2009. While the appeal was pending before the High Court, the 3rd defendant died and his legal heirs got themselves impleaded. The High Court took the view that disposition with regard to the above mentioned item was not ambulatory in quality or revocable in character during the lifetime of the executants and held that the disposition of the plaint item No. 1 is a settlement though possession and enjoyment were deferred. It was held that the executants had no right of disposal of that item and hence the transfer in favour of defendant No.3 and the subsequent assignment in favour of defendant No.4 were invalid. Aggrieved by the same, these appeals have been preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Shri T. L. Viswanatha Iyer, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that exhibit A1 does not postulate any transfer of ownership or title over 8th schedule by the executants to their sons so also schedule Nos. 7 and 9. Learned senior counsel submitted that items in schedule Nos. 7, 8 and 9 were under their absolute control of the executants and they had the full freedom to deal with those properties. Learned senior counsel referring to the various recitals in exhibit A1 agreement submitted so far as schedule Nos. 1 to 6 are concerned, the transfer of interest was absolute in character and settled on all the sons equally and rest of the three items of the schedule, the executants had retained those items to themselves and to that extent exhibit A1 operated only as a Will. Learned senior counsel pointed out that so far as schedule Nos. 7 and 9 are concerned, the courts found that they are testamentary in character and the same reasoning should have been applied in the case of items in schedule No. 8 as well. Learned senior counsel has laid considerable emphasis on the Malayalam words adheenadha (control) and swathanthryam (liberty/freedom). Learned senior counsel submitted those words clearly indicate that the intention was to keep items in schedule Nos. 7 and 9 to the executants in their control with full freedom subject to certain stipulations. Learned senior counsel also pointed out that exhibit A1 clearly indicates that items in schedule No. 8 would devolve on his sons only after the executants lifetime, if available. Learned senior counsel submitted that in the absence of any words/recitals of disposition/transfer of items in schedule No.8 in exhibit A1 conferring title in praesenti on the sons, the High Court was not justified in holding that exhibit A1 was not a Will in respect of that item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Shri Aljo K. Joseph, learned counsel appearing for the respondents on the other hand contended that the recital in the document relating to schedule No.8 is in the nature of a settlement bestowing vested rights in equal shares to all the children of late Shri Eapen and late Smt. Sosamma. Learned counsel submitted that the specific language of the recital in the agreement relating to schedule No.8 itself clearly indicates that rights are created in praesenti and at the most the enjoyment thereof was only postponed. Learned counsel submitted that while reading the agreement as a whole, the inevitable conclusion is that the document, particularly recital relating to schedule No.8, is in the nature of a settlement conferring vested rights on the sons of executants equally. Learned counsel submitted that the High Court was, therefore, justified in holding so, which calls for no interference by this Court in this appeal. Learned counsel also made reference to the judgments of this Court in P. K. Mohans Ram v. B. N. Ananthachary and Others (2010) 4 SCC 161 and Rajes Kanta Roy v. Shanti Debi and Another AIR 1957 SC 255.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. We are, in this case, concerned only with the question whether the recitals in Exhibit A1 document concerning the disposition of schedule No. 8 disclosed a testamentary disposition or is a settlement of that item in favour of the original plaintiffs and defendant Nos. 1 to 3 deferring its possession and enjoyment until the death of the executants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Exhibit A1 is written in Malayalam language, the English version of that document is given below:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Agreement dated 2nd day of Thulam 1125 M.E.

There are some amounts to be paid off by us by way of debt, incurred for conducting the family affairs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This agreement is executed in as much as all of you have attained majority and since we are becoming old, it was felt that it will be to the benefit of all and to avoid future family disputes and for the purpose of discharging the debt, to execute this agreement to divide the properties separately subject to the conditions specified below. The parties are to act accordingly.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The properties have been divided into schedule No. 1-9. The properties described as schedules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are absolutely settled respectively on numbers 1 to 6 among you. Schedule 7 is required for the marriage and dowry purposes of Thankamma, schedule 8 for the purpose of discharging the debt due to Land Mortgage Bank.

The right and responsibility of the dowry amount that parties Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 6 might receive when they get married shall lie on them only. The marriage of the said Thankamma shall be conducted by us, in our responsibility, during our life time, by creating for the purpose any kind of transactions as we desire on the property in schedule 7. If the said Thankamma is not married off during our life time, the property in schedule 7 shall, after our life time, belong absolutely (word used in Malayalam is Swathanthryam ) on Thankamma with complete possession, title and right, and Thankamma shall pay taxes, redeem the mortgage and enjoy the property. We are keeping possession of schedule No.8 utilizing the income derived by us directly, or by leasing out, to discharge the amounts due to the Bank without default and after the clearance of the debt, the income from schedule 8 property shall be utilized for our maintenance.

Exhibit A1 document is composite in character having special features of a testamentary disposition and a settlement in respect of items and properties covered in the Schedules. Before examining those special features and characteristics, let us examine the legal principles which apply while interpreting such a composite document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Settlement and Testamentary Disposition</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. We have already indicated that exhibit A1 document has both the characteristics of a settlement and a testamentary disposition. Let us examine the basic and fundamental difference between a testamentary disposition and a settlement. Will is an instrument whereunder a person makes a disposition of his properties to take effect after his death and which is in its own nature ambulatory and revocable during his lifetime. It has three essentials:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1) It must be a legal declaration of the testator s intention;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2) That declaration must be with respect to his property; and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>3) The desire of the testator that the said declaration should be effectuated after his death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>12. The essential quality of a testamentary disposition is ambulatoriness of revocability during the executants lifetime. Such a document is dependent upon executants death for its vigour and effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Section 2(h) of the Indian Succession Act says Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a testator with respect to his property which he desires to be carried into effect after his death . In the instant case, the executants were Indian Christians, the rules of law and the principles of construction laid down in the Indian Succession Act govern the interpretation of Will. In the interpretation of Will in India, regard must be had to the rules of law and construction contained in Part VI of the Indian Succession Act and not the rules of the Interpretation of Statutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Gift/settlement is the transfer of existing property made voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor to another called the donee and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. Gift takes effect by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines the gift as a voluntary transfer of property in consideration of the natural love and affection to a living person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. We may point out that in the case of a Will, the crucial circumstance is the existence of a provision disposing of or distributing the property of the testator to take</p>\r\n', '<p>K. S.

Will is an instrument whereunder a person makes a disposition of his properties to take effect after his death and which is in its own nature ambulatory and revocable during his lifetime. It has three essentials:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1) It must be a legal declaration of the testator s intention;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2) That declaration must be with respect to his property; and</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>3) The desire of the testator that the said declaration should be effectuated after his death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>12. The essential quality of a testamentary disposition is ambulatoriness of revocability during the executants lifetime. Such a document is dependent upon executants death for its vigour and effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Section 2(h) of the Indian Succession Act says Will means the legal declaration of the intention of a testator with respect to his property which he desires to be carried into effect after his death . In the instant case, the executants were Indian Christians, the rules of law and the principles of construction laid down in the Indian Succession Act govern the interpretation of Will. In the interpretation of Will in India, regard must be had to the rules of law and construction contained in Part VI of the Indian Succession Act and not the rules of the Interpretation of Statutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Gift/settlement is the transfer of existing property made voluntarily and without consideration by one person called the donor to another called the donee and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. Gift takes effect by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act defines the gift as a voluntary transfer of property in consideration of the natural love and affection to a living person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. We may point out that in the case of a Will, the crucial circumstance is the existence of a provision disposing of or distributing the property of the testator to take</p>\r\n', NULL, '100067763', '', '', 1, NULL, 'NA', 1, NULL, 'NA', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-10-05'),

Candidates for recruiting District Judges in the State\nof  Uttar  Pradesh. under the U.P. Higher  Judicial  Service\nRules.	framed	by the Government under Article 309  of	 the\nConstitution. could be drawn from flu&apos; sources i.e.  members\nof the Bar. Judicial Officers (a misleading expression)	 who\nare   members  of  the	Executive   Department	 discharging\nmagisterial  and some revenue duties. and by promotion	from\nmembers	 of U.P. Civil Services (Judicial Branch) under	 the\ncontrol of the High Court. Six appointments from two of	 the\nafore-described services. i three from the Bar and  three\nfrom the \"Judicial Ofticrs\" were proposed to be made by	 the\nState. after involving the High Court. when Chandra Mohan. a\nmember	of  the	 U.P. Civil Service  (Judicial	Branch)	 and\nothers	filed  a  writ petition in the High  Court  for	 the\nissuance of an appropriate writ directing the Government not\nto make the appointments pursuant to the proposal. Since the\nwrit  petition was dismissed and the matter was	 brought  to\nthis Court in appeal. the canvass of dispute. on account  of\nmany  points  involved.	 was  widely  spread.  but  for	 our\npurposes it would suffice to say that this Court ruled	that\nthe  Rules as such framed by the Governor empowering him  to\nrecruit	 Judges	 from the \"Judicial  Officers\"	source	were\nunconstitutional  and  the  recruitment	 of  the   \"Judicial\nOfficers\" was bad. It was emphasised by this Court that	 the\nIndian	 Constitution  had  provided  for   an	 Independent\nJudiciary in the States and in order to put the independence\nof the subordinate judiciary beyond question. provision	 had\nbeen  made in Article 50 of the Constitution in the  Chapter\nof Directive Principles for the Separation of the  judiciary\nfrom the executive. and further in enacting Articles 233  to\n237  in	 Part  VI.  Chapter  VI	 of  the  Constitution.	 the\nappointment of District Judges in any State was envisaged to\nbe made only from two sources i.e. (i) Service of the  Union\nor  of	the State; and (ii) members of the Bar.	 This  Court\nwent  on  to rule that the Service of the Union	 or  of	 the\nState men-\n</p> \n<p id=\"p_5\">tioned	in  the first category did not mean each  and  every\nservice of the Union or of the State but judicial service of\nthe Union or of the State. \"Judicial Service\" as defined  in\nArticle	 236(b)	 meant a service consisting  exclusively  of\npersons	 intended  to fill the post of	District  Judge	 and\nother Civil judicial posts inferior to the post of  District\nJudge.\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">4.     Gathering the history of the Service, it was  noticed\nthat after India attained independence in 1947, there  were,\nwhen the source&apos; of recruitment of Indian Civil Service	 had\ndied  out,  only two sources from which District Judges	 had\nbeen  recruited, i.e., either from the Judicial	 Service  or\nfrom  the  Bar,	 and there was no case of a  member  of	 the\nexecutive having ever been promoted as a District Judge.  In\nthis  backdrop, it was thought that recruitment of  District\nJudges	from  the  personnel  available	 in  the   Executive\nDepartment  could  be deleterious to the good  name  of	 the\njudiciary, and an attempt to undermine it had to be  frowned\nupon.  In  this backdrop, it was viewed by this	 Court	that\nmethodology  under  Article  237  of  the  Constitution	 was\navailable  where the Governor had the power to	notify	that\nArticles 223 to 226 could apply to Magistrates, subjected to\ncertain modifications or exceptions, if necessary,  and then\neffect	integration  of	 the  Magistrates  in  the  Judicial\nService,  which is one of the sources of recruitment to	 the\npost  of District Judges. It was emphasised that  till	such\nstep  is taken in the manner envisaged by Article  237,	 the\nMagistrates  (Judicial Officers) were outside the  scope  of\nArticles 223 to 226 of the Constitution.  In sum, under	 the\nrules  then existing, the State of Uttar Pradesh  could	 not\njustify the appointments of \"Judicial Officers\" as  District\nJudges and attracted a mandamus issued by the Court for	 not\nmaking	  any	 appointment	from	the    source	  of\nMagistrates/Judicial  Ofricers.	  The Rules  flamed  by	 the\nGovernor, without resort to Article 237,  empowering him  to\nrecruit	 District Judges from the \"Judicial  Officers\"	were\nthus	declared   unconstitutional   and   therefore	 the\nappointments  of  the  concerned  \"Judicial  Officers\"	were\ndeclared bad.\n</p><p id=\"p_7\">5.     The  State of Uttar Pradesh went about  clearing	 the\nfail out of Chander Mohan&apos;s case since the High Court on the\nadministrative	side was also anxious to do justice  tO	 the\nMagistrates/Judicial  Officers. We would in the language  of\nthe  High  Court,  say that the Governor  of  Uttar  Pradesh\nissued the notification dated March 12, 1975, under  Article\n237  of	 the Constitution directing that the  provisions  of\nChapter VI of Part VI of the Constitution and any rules made\nthereunder  shall with effect from the date of	notification\napply  to  Judicial Magistrates	 (including  Chief  Judicial\nMagistrates)  in  the  State who are  members  of  the	U.P.\nJudicial  Officers  Service  as they apply  in	relation  to\npersons	 appointed  to	the Judicial service  of  the  State\nsubject	 to two exceptions, namely, (1) the members  of	 the\nU.P.  Judicial Ofricers Service shall constitute a  judicial\nservice	 to  fill in the post of Additional  Sessions  Judge\nonly   for  purposes  of  Articles  233	 and  236   of	 the\nConstitution and (2) the U.P.Judicial Officers Service shall\nbe  a  service	distinct and separate from  the	 U.P.  Civil\nService (Judicial Branch). By means of this notification the\nJudicial  Magistrates  who  are	 members  of  the   Judicial\nOfficers Service have become eligible for appointment to the\npost  of  Additional  Sessions	Judge  included	 within	 the\ndefinition of \"District Judge\" as defined by Article\n \n236  of the Constitution. The notification further  declares\nthat  the  Judicial  Officers Service shall  be	 a  judicial\nservice.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">6.	By  another notification dated March 21,  1975,	 the\nGovernor  of Uttar Pradesh in exercise of his  powers  under\nArticle 309 read with Article 233 of the Constitution framed\nrules, namely, the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975,\nregulating  recruitment and appointment to the	U.P.  Higher\nJudicial  Service.   Under R.4 the Higher  Judicial  Service\nconsists of a single cadre comprising the posts of  District\nand  Sessions  Judges and Additional District  and  Sessions\nJudges.	 Rule 5 lays down the sources of recruitment to	 the\nservice:  according to it, recruitment to the service is  to\nbe made by two sources (a) by direct recruitment of pleaders\nand advocates of not less than seven years standing and	 (b)\nby  promotion of confirmed members of the U.P.	Nyayik	Sewa\n(Members of the U.P. Civil Service, Judicial Branch) who may\nhave put in not less than seven years service in that cadre.\nIn  addition  to  that	Judicial  Magistrates  and  Judicial\nOfficers  have	also been mad eligible for  appointment	 but\nonly  to  the  post of Additional  Sessions  Judge.  Rule  6\nprescribes  quota  for recruitment to the service  from	 the\nthree sources prescribed by R.5. The rule lays down that 70%\nof  the vacancies are to be filled in by promotion from	 the\nmembers	 of the Nyayik Sewa, while 15% of the vacancies	 are\nto  be	filled by direct recruitment of	 Advocates  and	 the\nremaining  15%	of  the vacancies are to  be  filled  in  by\npromotion  from	 amongst the members of	 the  U.P.  Judicial\nOfficers Service (Judicial Magistrates).\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">7.	In  Part VI of Chapter VI of the  Constitution,	 the\nword \"Magistrate\", though employed, in Article 237, does not\nfigure	to be defined and thus inevitably resort has  to  be\nmade  to Section 3(32) of the General Clauses Act,  1897  to\nnote   that  a	\"Magistrate\"  shall  include  every   person\nexercising all or any of the powers of the Magistrate  under\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure for the time being in  force.\nComing	to  the	 Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973,  as	 now\nexisting,  we have Courts and Magistrates  classified  under\nsection	 6 thereof, the latter as Judicial  Magistrates	 and\nExecutive Magistrates, and the Court of Session heading	 the\nclassification.	 Section  9  provides  that  very  Court  of\nSession shall be presided over by a Judge to be appointed by\nthe  High Court. The High Court may also appoint  Additional\nSessions  Judges and Assistant Sessions Judges	to  exercise\njurisdiction   in   a  Court  of  Session.   The   Executive\nMagistrates have roles and functions assigned to them  under\nthe Cod such as undertaking proceedings under sections	107,\n108,  109,  110,  111, 133, 133	 and  145  Cr.P.C.  Judicial\nMagistrates,  on  the other hand, are assigned	their  roles\nunder the Code primarily of trial of offences, as  envisaged\nunder section 26 of the Code.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">8.     The High Court rcorded its understanding of  the	 new\nrole of the Magistracy alter the 1973 Code in paragraph 9 of\nits judgment as follows:\n</p><blockquote>	      \"The   Code  of  Criminal	  Procedure,   1973,\n	      conferred	 power on the High Court to  appoint\n	      Sessions	Judge, Magistrates,  Chief  Judicial\n	      Magistrate  and  Special	Magistrates  and  to\n	      confer  Magisterial  powers on any  person  or\n	      authority.  Under the new Code, the  Executive\n	      has  nothing  to do with	the  appointment  of\n	      Magistrates. In pursuance of the provisions of\n	      the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the High\n	      Court of Allahabad appointed Chief\n \n	      Judicial Magistrates and the Magistrates&apos; with\n	      effect from l st April, 1974.  The persons  so\n	      appointed	 are  the  same	 persons  who	were\n	      earlier  functioning as  Judicial	 Magistrates\n	      who  had	been appointed by the  Governor	 and\n	      were  functioning as Judicial Officers.  After\n	      their  appointment by the High Court,  control\n	      over the Magistrates vested in the High Court.\n	      The Governor in order to effectuate the policy\n	      underlying  An.50 of the	Constitution  issued\n	      the  impugned notification dated	12th  March,\n	      1975  applying all the provisions of Chap.  VI\n	      of Part VI of the Constitution to the existing\n	      class   of  Magistrates.	The  intention	 and\n	      purpose  behind the issue of the	notification\n	      is to make the Magistracy free from  Executive\n	      influence	 and  to  make	them  part  of	 the\n	      Judicial Service of the State along with Civil\n	      Judiciary\"\n</blockquote><blockquote>	      9.     At this place, Articles 233, 234,	235,\n	      236  and 237 from Part VI, Chapter VI  of	 the\n	      Constitution may be read with advantage:\n	      \"233.

Judicial Ofricers Service shall constitute a  judicial\nservice	 to  fill in the post of Additional  Sessions  Judge\nonly   for  purposes  of  Articles  233	 and  236   of	 the\nConstitution and (2) the U.P.Judicial Officers Service shall\nbe  a  service	distinct and separate from  the	 U.P.  Civil\nService (Judicial Branch). By means of this notification the\nJudicial  Magistrates  who  are	 members  of  the   Judicial\nOfficers Service have become eligible for appointment to the\npost  of  Additional  Sessions	Judge  included	 within	 the\ndefinition of \"District Judge\" as defined by Article\n \n236  of the Constitution. The notification further  declares\nthat  the  Judicial  Officers Service shall  be	 a  judicial\nservice.\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">6.	By  another notification dated March 21,  1975,	 the\nGovernor  of Uttar Pradesh in exercise of his  powers  under\nArticle 309 read with Article 233 of the Constitution framed\nrules, namely, the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975,\nregulating  recruitment and appointment to the	U.P.  Higher\nJudicial  Service.   Under R.4 the Higher  Judicial  Service\nconsists of a single cadre comprising the posts of  District\nand  Sessions  Judges and Additional District  and  Sessions\nJudges.	 Rule 5 lays down the sources of recruitment to	 the\nservice:  according to it, recruitment to the service is  to\nbe made by two sources (a) by direct recruitment of pleaders\nand advocates of not less than seven years standing and	 (b)\nby  promotion of confirmed members of the U.P.	Nyayik	Sewa\n(Members of the U.P. Civil Service, Judicial Branch) who may\nhave put in not less than seven years service in that cadre.\nIn  addition  to  that	Judicial  Magistrates  and  Judicial\nOfficers  have	also been mad eligible for  appointment	 but\nonly  to  the  post of Additional  Sessions  Judge.  Rule  6\nprescribes  quota  for recruitment to the service  from	 the\nthree sources prescribed by R.5. The rule lays down that 70%\nof  the vacancies are to be filled in by promotion from	 the\nmembers	 of the Nyayik Sewa, while 15% of the vacancies	 are\nto  be	filled by direct recruitment of	 Advocates  and	 the\nremaining  15%	of  the vacancies are to  be  filled  in  by\npromotion  from	 amongst the members of	 the  U.P.  Judicial\nOfficers Service (Judicial Magistrates).\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">7.	In  Part VI of Chapter VI of the  Constitution,	 the\nword \"Magistrate\", though employed, in Article 237, does not\nfigure	to be defined and thus inevitably resort has  to  be\nmade  to Section 3(32) of the General Clauses Act,  1897  to\nnote   that  a	\"Magistrate\"  shall  include  every   person\nexercising all or any of the powers of the Magistrate  under\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure for the time being in  force.\nComing	to  the	 Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973,  as	 now\nexisting,  we have Courts and Magistrates  classified  under\nsection	 6 thereof, the latter as Judicial  Magistrates	 and\nExecutive Magistrates, and the Court of Session heading	 the\nclassification.	 Section  9  provides  that  very  Court  of\nSession shall be presided over by a Judge to be appointed by\nthe  High Court. The High Court may also appoint  Additional\nSessions  Judges and Assistant Sessions Judges	to  exercise\njurisdiction   in   a  Court  of  Session.   The   Executive\nMagistrates have roles and functions assigned to them  under\nthe Cod such as undertaking proceedings under sections	107,\n108,  109,  110,  111, 133, 133	 and  145  Cr.P.C.  Judicial\nMagistrates,  on  the other hand, are assigned	their  roles\nunder the Code primarily of trial of offences, as  envisaged\nunder section 26 of the Code.\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">8.     The High Court rcorded its understanding of  the	 new\nrole of the Magistracy alter the 1973 Code in paragraph 9 of\nits judgment as follows:\n</p><blockquote>	      \"The   Code  of  Criminal	  Procedure,   1973,\n	      conferred	 power on the High Court to  appoint\n	      Sessions	Judge, Magistrates,  Chief  Judicial\n	      Magistrate  and  Special	Magistrates  and  to\n	      confer  Magisterial  powers on any  person  or\n	      authority.  Under the new Code, the  Executive\n	      has  nothing  to do with	the  appointment  of\n	      Magistrates. In pursuance of the provisions of\n	      the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the High\n	      Court of Allahabad appointed Chief\n \n	      Judicial Magistrates and the Magistrates&apos; with\n	      effect from l st April, 1974.

VI\n	      of Part VI of the Constitution to the existing\n	      class   of  Magistrates.	The  intention	 and\n	      purpose  behind the issue of the	notification\n	      is to make the Magistracy free from  Executive\n	      influence	 and  to  make	them  part  of	 the\n	      Judicial Service of the State along with Civil\n	      Judiciary\"\n</blockquote><blockquote>	      9.

Time and place of unnatural death, of Asha Rani, by burning, at her in-laws\' small house with at least six inmates, could not and was no disputed.

Burning by kero- sene stove or gas or even firewood may not be unusual due to synthetic wear which has become very common. But when post mortem report indicates, as was in this case, that smell of kerosene was coming from body and even burnt hairs smelt kerosene then it not only belied the statement of her sis- ter-in-law (Nand) that she was burnt while making tea but it ruled out remotest possibility of accident.

Bride burning is a shame of our society. \r\n\r\nheld: this case we consider it necessary to record that the judge was uncharitable in discarding the testimony of Dr. Patricia and doubting her truthfulness principally because she was a woman forgetting that she was a doctor of 14 years standing and there was no reason for her to make the endorsement on the injury report other than stated that it was on request of Dr. Temani. We do not wish to comment further but we express our deep dissatisfaction on the manner in which the judge criticised the two doctors. For the reasons stated above we are of the opinion that the High Court did not commit any error in allowing the appeal and recording the conviction under Section 378 read with Section 386( 1 )(a) of the Indian Penal Code.\r\n\r\nIn the result this appeal fails and was dismissed.

Next\nand  most important link was the evidence of doctor  or	 the\ndetails	 of  what happened in the hospital. The	 victim	 was\nundisputedly  brought  in  the ward at 10.00  a.m.  She	 was\nexamined by Dr. Saxena PW 6, a student of first year of M.S.\ncourse.	 He  prepared the bed head ticket. Since  it  was  a\nserious	 case  he sent for Dr. Temani and Dr.  Patricia	 the\nmedical jurist. He stated that Dr. Temani examined her first\nand  Dr. Patricia came later. He stated that Asha  Rani	 was\nconscious from 10.00. a.m. to 11.00 a.m. He further admitted\nunequivocally  that  when she was admitted  she	 could	give\nclear  cut  answer of whatever was asked from her.  He	thus\nstated	three  vital  things, one preparation  of  bed	head\nticket and entries made on it, second about the sequence  in\nwhich  the doctors examined the patient and third  that	 the\nvictim	was conscious who could understand and give  answers\nof  whatever questions were asked from her. In the bed	head\nticket which was deposed to be written by him it was clearly\nmentioned  that Asha Rani complained of misbehaviour of	 her\nbrother-in-law. He made an unsuccessful attempt to wash	 off\nits  effect by stating that on his inquiry as to  who  burnt\nher  she did not disclose name of anyone. Nothing  turns  on\nthis part of the statement as he could not deny the entry in\nthe bed head ticket. No further need be said firstly because\nhe was a student only and secondly circumstances do not lie.\nHowever if the entry in bed head ticket and the statement on\nthree  vital aspects are not contradicted by the  other	 two\ndoctors	 either by taking their depositions individually  or\nwith Dr. Saxena then minor contradictions here and there not\nrelevant or material could not shake the prosecution case.\n    Dr.	 Temani	 examined  the deceased	 and  gave  detailed\ndescription in the injury report. It is also mentioned	that\nshe was burnt by her brother-in-law (Devar). He stated	that\non his inquiry Asha Rani told him that she was burnt by	 her\nbrother-in-law	(Devar)	 Ashok. He further stated  that	 the\nstatement was made in presence of Dr. Patricia\n \nwho on his asking made endorsement on the injury report.  In\ncross  examination he admitted that Dr. Patricia  came	five\nminutes	 after	him. He stated that the	 deceased  disclosed\nname  of Ashok in her presence. He further stated  that	 she\nwas conscious. Dr Patricia deposed that Asha Rani stated  in\nher  presence  stated on asking of Dr. Temani that  she	 was\nburnt  by Ashok Kumar. She admitted that the endorsement  on\nthe injury report that Asha Rani was burnt by her Devar	 was\nmade  by her on request of Dr. Temani. Thus on all  material\nparticulars the statements were consistent. The Judge  could\nnot  point out any contradiction on these important  aspects\nbut  discarded the statement of Dr. Temani and Dr.  Patricia\nbecause	 there	were contradictions as to how  many  persons\nwere  present  during examination by these doctors,  and  if\neven  earlier such dying declaration was recorded in  injury\nreport	and got endorsed by senior doctors and why the	doc-\ntors  did not disclose it to anyone and why the	 report	 was\nwritten by compounder on dictation of Dr. Temani and why was\nnot he examined. It was held, &apos;Dr. Temani has said about the\nstatement  by Asha Rani prior to examination by him and	 has\ndeposed about the presence of Dr. Patricia. Dr. Patricia  is\nstated	to  have recorded the statement of Asha	 Rani  after\nexamining.  Dr. Patricia and Dr. Rakesh, whom  Dr.  Patricia\nhas stated to be with her as a House Surgeon, has  falsified\nthe  statements of both the witness and it has been  clearly\nsaid  that before him Asha Rani said anything to Dr.  Temani\nnor  Dr.  Patricia nor Dr. Patricia or Dr.  Temani  examined\nAsha Rani before him. In this way there are vital contradic-\ntions between the statements of Dr. Patricia and Dr.  Temani\nand on account of refutal by the statement of Dr. Rakesh  in\nmy opinion, prima facie, it can be said that no reliance can\nbe placed on the statements of Dr. Patricia and Dr. Temani.&apos;\nThis  approach	of  the Judge apart from  being	 faulty	 was\ncontrary to the rule and appreciation of evidence. The	High\nCourt after going into detail and examining the evidence  of\neach of these witnesses has found that there was no material\ncontradiction either on the question of presence of the	 two\ndoctors of the sequence in which she was examined by them or\nin  respect of recording of bed head ticket and	 the  injury\nreport.

He made an unsuccessful attempt to wash	 off\nits  effect by stating that on his inquiry as to  who  burnt\nher  she did not disclose name of anyone. Nothing  turns  on\nthis part of the statement as he could not deny the entry in\nthe bed head ticket. No further need be said firstly because\nhe was a student only and secondly circumstances do not lie.\nHowever if the entry in bed head ticket and the statement on\nthree  vital aspects are not contradicted by the  other	 two\ndoctors	 either by taking their depositions individually  or\nwith Dr. Saxena then minor contradictions here and there not\nrelevant or material could not shake the prosecution case.\n    Dr.	 Temani	 examined  the deceased	 and  gave  detailed\ndescription in the injury report. It is also mentioned	that\nshe was burnt by her brother-in-law (Devar). He stated	that\non his inquiry Asha Rani told him that she was burnt by	 her\nbrother-in-law	(Devar)	 Ashok. He further stated  that	 the\nstatement was made in presence of Dr. Patricia\n \nwho on his asking made endorsement on the injury report.  In\ncross  examination he admitted that Dr. Patricia  came	five\nminutes	 after	him. He stated that the	 deceased  disclosed\nname  of Ashok in her presence. He further stated  that	 she\nwas conscious. Dr Patricia deposed that Asha Rani stated  in\nher  presence  stated on asking of Dr. Temani that  she	 was\nburnt  by Ashok Kumar. She admitted that the endorsement  on\nthe injury report that Asha Rani was burnt by her Devar	 was\nmade  by her on request of Dr. Temani. Thus on all  material\nparticulars the statements were consistent. The Judge  could\nnot  point out any contradiction on these important  aspects\nbut  discarded the statement of Dr. Temani and Dr.  Patricia\nbecause	 there	were contradictions as to how  many  persons\nwere  present  during examination by these doctors,  and  if\neven  earlier such dying declaration was recorded in  injury\nreport	and got endorsed by senior doctors and why the	doc-\ntors  did not disclose it to anyone and why the	 report	 was\nwritten by compounder on dictation of Dr. Temani and why was\nnot he examined. It was held, &apos;Dr. Temani has said about the\nstatement  by Asha Rani prior to examination by him and	 has\ndeposed about the presence of Dr. Patricia. Dr. Patricia  is\nstated	to  have recorded the statement of Asha	 Rani  after\nexamining.  Dr. Patricia and Dr. Rakesh, whom  Dr.  Patricia\nhas stated to be with her as a House Surgeon, has  falsified\nthe  statements of both the witness and it has been  clearly\nsaid  that before him Asha Rani said anything to Dr.  Temani\nnor  Dr.  Patricia nor Dr. Patricia or Dr.  Temani  examined\nAsha Rani before him. In this way there are vital contradic-\ntions between the statements of Dr. Patricia and Dr.  Temani\nand on account of refutal by the statement of Dr. Rakesh  in\nmy opinion, prima facie, it can be said that no reliance can\nbe placed on the statements of Dr. Patricia and Dr. Temani.&apos;\nThis  approach	of  the Judge apart from  being	 faulty	 was\ncontrary to the rule and appreciation of evidence. The	High\nCourt after going into detail and examining the evidence  of\neach of these witnesses has found that there was no material\ncontradiction either on the question of presence of the	 two\ndoctors of the sequence in which she was examined by them or\nin  respect of recording of bed head ticket and	 the  injury\nreport.
